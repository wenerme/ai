With Agent Platform in express mode, you can quickly sign up and begin
building generative AI applications on Google Cloud. This
simplified setup experience streamlines access to Google Cloud APIs by
simplifying organization, billing, and project management.

To learn more about Agent Platform in express mode, see [Google Cloud
express mode FAQs](https://cloud.google.com/resources/cloud-express-faqs).

## Sign up for express mode

Agent Platform is available in express mode for developers with a
`@gmail.com` [Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/):

- **New users**: New users to Google Cloud can sign up for an express
  mode account in a free tier to try Agent Platform for free for up to
  90 days, within the specified quotas. You don't need to provide billing
  information to sign up in the free tier. You can upgrade to a paid tier by
  adding a billing account.

  Agent Platform in express mode is separate from, and not available
  through, the [Google Cloud Free
  Program](https://docs.cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features). If you are in the [Google Cloud Free Program](https://docs.cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features), see the
  other quickstarts in the **Get Started** section.

To sign up for Agent Platform in express mode, access **Express Mode**
from the Google Cloud console:

[Go to Express Mode](https://console.cloud.google.com/expressmode)

After you're set up, you can start using Agent Platform in express mode
by following one of the tutorials:

- [Tutorial: Agent Studio in express mode](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/start/express-mode/vertex-ai-studio-express-mode-quickstart)
- [Tutorial: Agent Platform API in express mode](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/start/express-mode/vertex-ai-express-mode-api-quickstart)

## Learn about Agent Platform in express mode

When you sign up for express mode, Google Cloud enables APIs on your
behalf. This process happens in the background, so you can start using
Agent Platform without needing to manually configure resources.

When you sign up for express mode, you get access to the following:

- **Core Agent Studio features**. Quickly test and customize prompts for different generative AI models, and get the corresponding code to use in your application.
- **An API key**. Authenticate fast from your application.
- **Free tier for new Google Cloud users during 90 days** . During the 90 day limit of the free tier for new Google Cloud users, you can use the [Agent Platform APIs that support express mode](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/reference/express-mode/api-reference) for free, up to their quotas. You don't have to provide billing information. You can increase your quota limits at any time by [enabling
  billing](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/start/express-mode/overview#billing).

If you are an existing Google Cloud user or after enabling billing, the 90
day free tier is removed. You transition to a paid tier to access extended quota
limits and additional Google Cloud features. As your quotas are increased,
you only pay for what you use. At any time, you can choose to [end express
mode](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/start/express-mode/overview#endexpressmode) and start using all the Google Cloud services and
capabilities.

The following table lists the differences between the express mode experiences
and the full Agent Platform experience:

| Item | Agent Platform express mode in the free tier | Full Agent Platform |
|---|---|---|
| Time limit | 90 days | Unlimited |
| Available services | Basic generative AI services. | All Google Cloud services, including Agent Platform. |
| Data sources | Google Drive | All data sources available in Google Cloud. |
| Quota | Free tier limits. See [Available models and rate limits in express mode](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/start/express-mode/overview#models). | Standard pay-as-you-go limits. See [Rate limits](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/quotas). |
| Standard format of API endpoints | Specify API key instead of project ID and location. For example: `https://aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/publishers/google/models/{model}:streamGenerateContent?key={API_KEY}` | Specify project ID and location. For example: `https://{location}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/publishers/google/models/{model}:streamGenerateContent` |

## Available models and rate limits in express mode

You can try out several models in express mode, including the latest
Gemini Flash models. The following table lists the models that are
available in express mode, along with their rate limits:

| Model category | Available models | Maximum requests per minute |
|---|---|---|
| Gemini | `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` | [Dynamic](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/resources/throughput-quota) |
| Gemini | `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | [Dynamic](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/resources/throughput-quota) |
| Gemini | `gemini-3-flash-preview` | [Dynamic](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/resources/throughput-quota) |

| Gemini |
| Gemini |
| Gemini |

For Gemini 2.0 models, the [Live API](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/live-api) isn't available in the
Google Cloud console in express mode. To use the Live API in express
mode, use the Agent Platform API or the Google Gen AI SDK.

## Agent Platform in express mode workflow

You can start sending requests from your application to Agent Platform
APIs in three steps:

1. After [signing up for express mode](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/start/express-mode/overview#eligibility), use
   Agent Studio to quickly try Agent Platform features:

   [Go to Agent Studio](https://console.cloud.google.com/agent-platform/studio)

   For example, select **Agent Studio \> Create prompt** to create and
   optimize multimodal prompts using a variety of Gemini models.
2. Get the code for what you implemented with the UI.

   On the prompt page, click **Build with code \> Get code** . A panel opens
   showing code that programmatically sends the same requests that you
   implemented in the UI. You can get the code for a programming language or
   curl. You can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to try
   the Python code.
3. Use your API key to authenticate with the Agent Platform API.

   In Google Cloud console in express mode, open **APIs \& Services \> Credentials**:

   [Go to Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)

   Then, copy your Generative Language API Key into your code where it says
   `"YOUR_API_KEY"`. For example:

   ### Python

   The Google Gen AI SDK for Python is available on PyPI and GitHub:
   - [`google-genai` on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/)
   - [`python-genai` on GitHub](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai)

   To learn more, see the
   [Python SDK reference (opens in a new tab)](https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/).

       from google import genai

       # TODO(developer): Update below line
       API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

       client = genai.Client(vertexai=True, api_key=API_KEY)

       response = client.models.generate_content(
           model="gemini-3.5-flash",
           contents="Explain bubble sort to me.",
       )

       print(response.text)
       # Example response:
       # Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list

## What's different in express mode

Agent Platform in express mode provides a subset of the features for
generative AI. Therefore, some of the Agent Platform
documentation is not relevant if you signed up in express mode. For details on
the available API endpoints in express mode, see the [Agent Platform in
express mode REST API
reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/reference/express-mode/api-reference).

In addition, customers in Google Cloud typically use
*organizations* and *projects* to work with resources (for example, to call an
API endpoint). When using Agent Platform in express mode, you don't need
to worry about organizations or projects. However, you might see them mentioned
in some of the Google Cloud documentation that you reference while you're
using Agent Platform in express mode. You can still use the
documentation, but ignore concepts and instructions that refer to organizations
and projects. In addition, the [location](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/resources/locations) you
selected when signing up in express mode is used throughout your experience.

When calling REST API endpoints in express mode, you'll use the endpoint format
for express mode and specify your API key. For example:

|---|---|
| Standard endpoint URL | `https://{location}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/publishers/google/models/{model}:streamGenerateContent` |
| Endpoint URL in express mode | `https://aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/publishers/google/models/{model}:streamGenerateContent?key={API_KEY}` |

## View and manage API keys

To authenticate with [Agent Platform API endpoints that support express
mode](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/reference/express-mode/api-reference),
use the API key that was created for you during sign-up or any key that you've
created in express mode. An API key is an encrypted string that is
auto-generated for you when you sign up in express mode. These API keys can be
viewed and managed on the **APIs \& Services** page.

To learn more about the best practices for managing API keys, see [Best
practices for managing API keys](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys-best-practices).

To view and manage your API keys, do the following:

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **API Keys** page:

   [Go to API Keys](https://console.cloud.google.com/agent-platform/studio/settings/api-keys)

## Enable and manage billing

You can increase your quotas and remove the 90 day limit by enabling billing.

After enabling billing, you pay only for what you use. You can also save your
prompts and access additional settings in the Google Cloud console that are that
grayed out when billing isn't enabled.

To manage billing, do the following:

1. Go to the Agent Studio Overview page in express mode.

   [Go to Agent Studio](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial/?redirectPath=/agent-platform/studio)
2. In Google Cloud console in express mode, open **Billing**:

   [Go to Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/linkedaccount)

3. Manage your billing accounts.

## Start using all Google Cloud capabilities and services

Express mode is designed to help you get started quickly. When you're ready to
use other Google Cloud services or need more control over your
environment, you can transition your express mode account to a standard
Google Cloud account. This process is sometimes called *upgrade*.

You can start using all the capabilities and services available in
Google Cloud in your project by upgrading your express mode account.

To upgrade from express mode, do the following:

1. Go to the Agent Studio Overview page in express mode.

   [Go to Agent Studio](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial/?redirectPath=/agent-platform/studio)
2. Click **Activate now** and follow the instructions.

After you upgrade from express mode, specify your project ID and location
instead of your API key when you call the REST API endpoints. For example:

    https://{location}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{projectid}/locations/{location}/publishers/google/models/{model}:streamGenerateContent
