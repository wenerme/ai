### Before you begin

Anthropic enforces policies that prohibit certain resellers from reselling their
products. If your Google Cloud billing account is managed by a prohibited
reseller, you will be unable to accept the Terms of Service or enable Claude
models. If this occurs, please contact your reseller directly.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** If enabling Claude models using Marketplace within an Assured Workloads boundary, you may be required to create an exception for `cloudcommerceconsumerprocurement.googleapis.com` and `commerceagreement.googleapis.com`. For more information on the exception process, see [Add violation exceptions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/assured-workloads/docs/monitor-folder#exception).

To use the Anthropic Claude models with Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform, you must perform the
following steps. The Agent Platform API (`aiplatform.googleapis.com`) must
be enabled to use Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform. If you already have an existing project with
the Agent Platform API enabled, you can use that project instead of creating
a new project.

Make sure you have the required permissions to enable and use partner models.
For more information, see [Grant the required permissions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/partner-models/use-partner-models#grant-permissions).

### Use a curl command

You can use a curl command to make a request to the Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform endpoint.
The curl command specifies which supported Claude model you want to use.

The following topic shows you how to create a curl command and includes a sample
curl command.

### REST

To test a text prompt by using the Agent Platform API, send a POST request to the
publisher model endpoint.
The following sample uses regional endpoints. To use the multi-region or global endpoint, see [Specify the multi-region endpoint](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/partner-models/use-partner-models#multi-region) or [Specify the global endpoint](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/partner-models/use-partner-models#global).

Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:

- <var class="edit" scope="LOCATION" translate="no">LOCATION</var>: A [region](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/partner-models/claude/use-claude#regions) that supports Anthropic Claude models. To use the global endpoint, see [Specify
  the global endpoint](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/partner-models/use-partner-models#global).
- <var class="edit" scope="MODEL" translate="no">MODEL</var>: The [model name](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/partner-models/claude/use-claude#model-list) you want to use.
- <var class="edit" scope="ROLE" translate="no">ROLE</var>: The role associated with a message. You can specify a `user` or an `assistant`. The first message must use the `user` role. Claude models operate with alternating `user` and `assistant` turns. If the final message uses the `assistant` role, then the response content continues immediately from the content in that message. You can use this to constrain part of the model's response.
- <var class="edit" scope="STREAM" translate="no">STREAM</var>: A boolean that specifies whether the response is streamed or not. Stream your response to reduce the end-use latency perception. Set to `true` to stream the response and `false` to return the response all at once.
- <var class="edit" scope="CONTENT" translate="no">CONTENT</var>: The content, such as text, of the `user` or `assistant` message.
- <var class="edit" scope="MAX_TOKENS" translate="no">MAX_TOKENS</var>: Maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the response. A token is approximately 3.5 characters. 100 tokens correspond to roughly 60-80 words.

  Specify a lower value for shorter responses and a higher value for potentially longer
  responses.
- <var class="edit" scope="TOP_P" translate="no">TOP_P</var> (Optional): Top-P changes how the model selects tokens for output. Tokens are selected from the most probable to least probable until the sum of their probabilities equals the top-P value. For example, if tokens A, B, and C have a probability of 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 and the top-P value is `0.5`, then the model will select either A or B as the next token by using temperature and excludes C as a candidate.

  Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more
  random responses.
- <var class="edit" scope="TOP_K" translate="no">TOP_K</var>(Optional): Top-K changes how the model selects tokens for output. A top-K of `1` means the next selected token is the most probable among all tokens in the model's vocabulary (also called greedy decoding), while a top-K of `3` means that the next token is selected from among the three most probable tokens by using temperature.

  For each token selection step, the top-K tokens with the highest
  probabilities are sampled. Then tokens are further filtered based on top-P with
  the final token selected using temperature sampling.

  Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more
  random responses.
- <var class="edit" scope="THINKING_TYPE" translate="no">TYPE</var>: For Claude 3.7 Sonnet and later Claude models, to enable extended thinking mode, specify `enabled`.
- <var class="edit" scope="THINKING_BUDGET" translate="no">BUDGET_TOKENS</var>: If you enable extended thinking, you must specify the number of tokens that the model can use for its internal reasoning as part of the output. Larger budgets can enable more thorough analysis for complex problems and improve response quality. You must specify a value greater than or equal to `1024` but less than `MAX_TOKENS`.

HTTP method and URL:

```

### Tool use (function calling)

The Anthropic Claude models support tools and function calling to enhance a
model's capabilities. For more information, see the
[Tool use overview](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use) in the Anthropic documentation. Claude models on Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform support Client tools, but Server tools are not supported.

The following samples demonstrate how to use tools by using an SDK or curl
command. The samples search for nearby restaurants in San Francisco that are
open.
