## Parameters

Synchronous — Send a request and receive a complete response

prompt

frequency\_penalty

`number | null`Penalizes new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far.

logit\_bias

`object | null`Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Maps token IDs to bias values from -100 to 100.

logprobs

`boolean | null`Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens.

top\_logprobs

`integer | null`How many top log probabilities to return at each token position (0-20). Requires logprobs=true.

max\_tokens

`integer | null`Deprecated in favor of max\_completion\_tokens. The maximum number of tokens to generate.

max\_completion\_tokens

`integer | null`An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion.

metadata

`object | null`Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to the object.

modalities

n

`integer | null`How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message.

parallel\_tool\_calls

`boolean`default: trueWhether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

▶prediction{}

`object`

presence\_penalty

`number | null`Penalizes new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far.

reasoning\_effort

`string | null`Constrains effort on reasoning for reasoning models (o1, o3-mini, etc.).

▶chat\_template\_kwargs{}

`object`

▶response\_format

`one of`Specifies the format the model must output.

seed

`integer | null`If specified, the system will make a best effort to sample deterministically.

▶tools\[\]

`array`A list of tools the model may call.

top\_p

`number | null`Nucleus sampling: considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass.
