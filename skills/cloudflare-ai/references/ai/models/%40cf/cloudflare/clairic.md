## Usage

```ts
export interface Env {
	AI: Ai;
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
		const response = await env.AI.run("@cf/cloudflare/clairic", {
			model: "clairic",
			state: "Invoice INV-2291 from Northwind Supply, issued 2026-09-02, net 30. 4 pallets at $250.00 each, shipping $80.00. Contact: Dana Ruiz, Priya Shah.",
			fields: {
				invoice_number: { type: "text" },
				due_date: {
					type: "date",
					instructions: "Issue date plus the net payment days",
				},
				total: {
					type: "number",
					decimals: 2,
					unit: "USD",
					instructions: "Amount due including shipping",
				},
				contacts: { type: "list", items: "text" },
				po_number: { type: "text", instructions: "Purchase order number" },
				days_to_pay: {
					type: "estimate",
					min: 0,
					max: 120,
					step: 1,
					instructions: "Days after issue until this invoice is paid",
				},
			},
		});

		// response.answers.invoice_number -> exact span of the state, with character offsets
		// response.answers.due_date       -> date worked out from the issue date and terms
		// response.answers.po_number      -> null: the invoice has no PO number
		// response.answers.days_to_pay    -> median and 80% interval (p10 to p90)
		return Response.json(response);
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
