# Define success criteria and build evaluations

---

Building a successful LLM-based application starts with clearly defining your success criteria and then designing evaluations to measure performance against them. This cycle is central to prompt engineering.

## Define your success criteria

Good success criteria are:
- **Specific:** Clearly define what you want to achieve. Instead of "good performance," specify "accurate sentiment classification."
- **Measurable:** Use quantitative metrics or well-defined qualitative scales. Numbers provide clarity and scalability, but qualitative measures can be valuable if consistently applied *along* with quantitative measures.
    - Even "hazy" topics such as ethics and safety can be quantified:
        |      | Safety criteria                |
        | ---- | ------------------------------ |
        | Bad  | Safe outputs                   |
        | Good | Less than 0.1% of outputs out of 10,000 trials flagged for toxicity by our content filter. |
    <section title="Example metrics and measurement methods">

        **Quantitative metrics:**
            - Task-specific: F1 score, BLEU score, perplexity
            - Generic: Accuracy, precision, recall
            - Operational: Response time (ms), uptime (%)

        **Quantitative methods:**
            - A/B testing: Compare performance against a baseline model or earlier version.
            - User feedback: Implicit measures like task completion rates.
            - Edge case analysis: Percentage of edge cases handled without errors.

        **Qualitative scales:**
            - Likert scales: "Rate coherence from 1 (nonsensical) to 5 (perfectly logical)"
            - Expert rubrics: Linguists rating translation quality on defined criteria
    
</section>
- **Achievable:** Base your targets on industry benchmarks, prior experiments, AI research, or expert knowledge. Your success metrics should not be unrealistic to current frontier model capabilities.
- **Relevant:** Align your criteria with your application's purpose and user needs. Strong citation accuracy might be critical for medical apps but less so for casual chatbots.

<section title="Example task fidelity criteria for sentiment analysis">

    |      | Criteria                                                     |
    | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Bad  | The model should classify sentiments well                    |
    | Good | Our sentiment analysis model should achieve an F1 score of at least 0.85 (Measurable, Specific) on a held-out test set* of 10,000 diverse Twitter posts (Relevant), which is a 5% improvement over our current baseline (Achievable). |

    \*More on held-out test sets in the next section.

### Common success criteria

Here are some criteria that might be important for your use case. This list is non-exhaustive.

  <section title="Task fidelity">

    How well does the model need to perform on the task? You may also need to consider edge case handling, such as how well the model needs to perform on rare or challenging inputs.
  
</section>
  <section title="Consistency">

    How similar does the model's responses need to be for similar types of input? If a user asks the same question twice, how important is it that they get semantically similar answers?
  
</section>
  <section title="Relevance and coherence">

    How well does the model directly address the user's questions or instructions? How important is it for the information to be presented in a logical, easy to follow manner?
  
</section>
  <section title="Tone and style">

    How well does the model's output style match expectations? How appropriate is its language for the target audience?
  
</section>
  <section title="Privacy preservation">

    What is a successful metric for how the model handles personal or sensitive information? Can it follow instructions not to use or share certain details?
  
</section>
  <section title="Context utilization">

    How effectively does the model use provided context? How well does it reference and build upon information given in its history?
  
</section>
  <section title="Latency">

    What is the acceptable response time for the model? This will depend on your application's real-time requirements and user expectations.
  
</section>
  <section title="Price">

    What is your budget for running the model? Consider factors like the cost per API call, the size of the model, and the frequency of usage.
  
</section>

Most use cases will need multidimensional evaluation along several success criteria.

<section title="Example multidimensional criteria for sentiment analysis">

    |      | Criteria                                                     |
    | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Bad  | The model should classify sentiments well                    |
    | Good | On a held-out test set of 10,000 diverse Twitter posts, our sentiment analysis model should achieve:<br/>- an F1 score of at least 0.85<br/>- 99.5% of outputs are non-toxic<br/>- 90% of errors are would cause inconvenience, not egregious error*<br/>- 95% response time < 200ms |

    \*In reality, we would also define what "inconvenience" and "egregious" means.

## Build evaluations

### Eval design principles

1. **Be task-specific:** Design evals that mirror your real-world task distribution. Don't forget to factor in edge cases!
    <section title="Example edge cases">

       - Irrelevant or nonexistent input data
       - Overly long input data or user input
       - [Chat use cases] Poor, harmful, or irrelevant user input
       - Ambiguous test cases where even humans would find it hard to reach an assessment consensus
    
</section>
2. **Automate when possible:** Structure questions to allow for automated grading (e.g., multiple-choice, string match, code-graded, LLM-graded).
3. **Prioritize volume over quality:** More questions with slightly lower signal automated grading is better than fewer questions with high-quality human hand-graded evals.

### Example evals

  <section title="Task fidelity (sentiment analysis) - exact match evaluation">

    **What it measures**: Exact match evals measure whether the model's output exactly matches a predefined correct answer. It's a simple, unambiguous metric that's perfect for tasks with clear-cut, categorical answers like sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral).

    **Example eval test cases**: 1000 tweets with human-labeled sentiments.
    ```python
    import anthropic

    tweets = [
        {"text": "This movie was a total waste of time. 👎", "sentiment": "negative"},
        {"text": "The new album is 🔥! Been on repeat all day.", "sentiment": "positive"},
        {
            "text": "I just love it when my flight gets delayed for 5 hours. #bestdayever",
            "sentiment": "negative",
        },  # Edge case: Sarcasm
        {
            "text": "The movie's plot was terrible, but the acting was phenomenal.",
            "sentiment": "mixed",
        },  # Edge case: Mixed sentiment
        # ... 996 more tweets
    ]

    client = anthropic.Anthropic()


    def get_completion(prompt: str):
        message = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-opus-4-6",
            max_tokens=50,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        )
        return message.content[0].text


    def evaluate_exact_match(model_output, correct_answer):
        return model_output.strip().lower() == correct_answer.lower()


    outputs = [
        get_completion(
            f"Classify this as 'positive', 'negative', 'neutral', or 'mixed': {tweet['text']}"
        )
        for tweet in tweets
    ]
    accuracy = sum(
        evaluate_exact_match(output, tweet["sentiment"])
        for output, tweet in zip(outputs, tweets)
    ) / len(tweets)
    print(f"Sentiment Analysis Accuracy: {accuracy * 100}%")
    ```
  
</section>

  <section title="Consistency (FAQ bot) - cosine similarity evaluation">

    **What it measures**: Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors (in this case, sentence embeddings of the model's output using SBERT) by computing the cosine of the angle between them. Values closer to 1 indicate higher similarity. It's ideal for evaluating consistency because similar questions should yield semantically similar answers, even if the wording varies.

    **Example eval test cases**: 50 groups with a few paraphrased versions each.
    ```python
    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
    import numpy as np
    import anthropic

    faq_variations = [
        {
            "questions": [
                "What's your return policy?",
                "How can I return an item?",
                "Wut's yur retrn polcy?",
            ],
            "answer": "Our return policy allows...",
        },  # Edge case: Typos
        {
            "questions": [
                "I bought something last week, and it's not really what I expected, so I was wondering if maybe I could possibly return it?",
                "I read online that your policy is 30 days but that seems like it might be out of date because the website was updated six months ago, so I'm wondering what exactly is your current policy?",
            ],
            "answer": "Our return policy allows...",
        },  # Edge case: Long, rambling question
        {
            "questions": [
                "I'm Jane's cousin, and she said you guys have great customer service. Can I return this?",
                "Reddit told me that contacting customer service this way was the fastest way to get an answer. I hope they're right! What is the return window for a jacket?",
            ],
            "answer": "Our return policy allows...",
        },  # Edge case: Irrelevant info
        # ... 47 more FAQs
    ]

    client = anthropic.Anthropic()


    def get_completion(prompt: str):
        message = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-opus-4-6",
            max_tokens=2048,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],

        return message.content[0].text


    def evaluate_cosine_similarity(outputs):
        model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
        embeddings = [model.encode(output) for output in outputs]

        cosine_similarities = np.dot(embeddings, embeddings.T) / (
            np.linalg.norm(embeddings, axis=1) * np.linalg.norm(embeddings, axis=1).T
        )
        return np.mean(cosine_similarities)


    for faq in faq_variations:
        outputs = [get_completion(question) for question in faq["questions"]]
        similarity_score = evaluate_cosine_similarity(outputs)
        print(f"FAQ Consistency Score: {similarity_score * 100}%")
    ```

  <section title="Relevance and coherence (summarization) - ROUGE-L evaluation">

    **What it measures**: ROUGE-L (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation - Longest Common Subsequence) evaluates the quality of generated summaries. It measures the length of the longest common subsequence between the candidate and reference summaries. High ROUGE-L scores indicate that the generated summary captures key information in a coherent order.

    **Example eval test cases**: 200 articles with reference summaries.
    ```python
    from rouge import Rouge
    import anthropic

    articles = [
        {
            "text": "In a groundbreaking study, researchers at MIT...",
            "summary": "MIT scientists discover a new antibiotic...",
        },
        {
            "text": "Jane Doe, a local hero, made headlines last week for saving... In city hall news, the budget... Meteorologists predict...",

  <section title="Tone and style (customer service) - LLM-based Likert scale">

    **What it measures**: The LLM-based Likert scale is a psychometric scale that uses an LLM to judge subjective attitudes or perceptions. Here, it's used to rate the tone of responses on a scale from 1 to 5. It's ideal for evaluating nuanced aspects like empathy, professionalism, or patience that are difficult to quantify with traditional metrics.

    **Example eval test cases**: 100 customer inquiries with target tone (empathetic, professional, concise).
    ```python
    import anthropic

    inquiries = [
        {
            "text": "This is the third time you've messed up my order. I want a refund NOW!",
            "tone": "empathetic",
        },  # Edge case: Angry customer
        {

  <section title="Privacy preservation (medical chatbot) - LLM-based binary classification">

    **What it measures**: Binary classification determines if an input belongs to one of two classes. Here, it's used to classify whether a response contains PHI or not. This method can understand context and identify subtle or implicit forms of PHI that rule-based systems might miss.

    **Example eval test cases**: 500 simulated patient queries, some with PHI.
    ```python
    import anthropic

    patient_queries = [
        {"query": "What are the side effects of Lisinopril?", "contains_phi": False},

  <section title="Context utilization (conversation assistant) - LLM-based ordinal scale">

    **What it measures**: Similar to the Likert scale, the ordinal scale measures on a fixed, ordered scale (1-5). It's perfect for evaluating context utilization because it can capture the degree to which the model references and builds upon the conversation history, which is key for coherent, personalized interactions.

    **Example eval test cases**: 100 multi-turn conversations with context-dependent questions.
    ```python
    import anthropic

## Grade your evaluations

When deciding which method to use to grade evals, choose the fastest, most reliable, most scalable method:

1. **Code-based grading:** Fastest and most reliable, extremely scalable, but also lacks nuance for more complex judgements that require less rule-based rigidity.
   - Exact match: `output == golden_answer`
   - String match: `key_phrase in output`

2. **Human grading:** Most flexible and high quality, but slow and expensive. Avoid if possible.

3. **LLM-based grading:** Fast and flexible, scalable and suitable for complex judgement. Test to ensure reliability first then scale.

### Tips for LLM-based grading
- **Have detailed, clear rubrics:** "The answer should always mention 'Acme Inc.' in the first sentence. If it does not, the answer is automatically graded as 'incorrect.'"
    <Note>A given use case, or even a specific success criteria for that use case, might require several rubrics for holistic evaluation.</Note>
- **Empirical or specific:** For example, instruct the LLM to output only 'correct' or 'incorrect', or to judge from a scale of 1-5. Purely qualitative evaluations are hard to assess quickly and at scale.
- **Encourage reasoning:** Ask the LLM to think first before deciding an evaluation score, and then discard the reasoning. This increases evaluation performance, particularly for tasks requiring complex judgement.

<section title="Example: LLM-based grading">

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()


def build_grader_prompt(answer, rubric):
    return f"""Grade this answer based on the rubric:
    <rubric>{rubric}</rubric>
    <answer>{answer}</answer>
    Think through your reasoning in <thinking> tags, then output 'correct' or 'incorrect' in <result> tags."""


def grade_completion(output, golden_answer):
    grader_response = (
        client.messages.create(
            model="claude-opus-4-6",
            max_tokens=2048,
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": build_grader_prompt(output, golden_answer)}
            ],
        )
        .content[0]
        .text
    )

    return "correct" if "correct" in grader_response.lower() else "incorrect"


# Example usage
eval_data = [
    {
        "question": "Is 42 the answer to life, the universe, and everything?",
        "golden_answer": "Yes, according to 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'.",
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the capital of France?",
        "golden_answer": "The capital of France is Paris.",
    },
]


def get_completion(prompt: str):
    message = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-opus-4-6",
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    )
    return message.content[0].text


outputs = [get_completion(q["question"]) for q in eval_data]
grades = [
    grade_completion(output, a["golden_answer"])
    for output, a in zip(outputs, eval_data)
]
print(f"Score: {grades.count('correct') / len(grades) * 100}%")
```
