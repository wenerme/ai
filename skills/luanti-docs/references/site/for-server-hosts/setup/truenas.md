luanti is available as a [TrueNAS App](https://apps.truenas.com/catalog/luanti/). Please first follow the guide for installing an app: https://apps.truenas.com/managing-apps/installing-apps/. 

#### Selecting a Game

by default, TrueNAS has minetest game. First find any game you would like at https://content.luanti.org/packages/?type=game, and note the author and package name. In the app configuration, put the author name in the author field, and the package name in map name configuration field. Yes, you read the package name configuration field name correctly, see [this issue](https://github.com/truenas/apps/issues/3106) for more details on the naming of that field. There is also the release field, but it is recommended to leave that blank for the latest package release.

#### Port

It should be noted that TrueNAS serves luanti on port `30205` rather than luanti's default of `30000`

#### Configuration Options
