# Admin activity logs

Admin activity logs record configuration changes made by members of your Cloudflare account. These logs are useful for auditing who changed a policy or setting and investigating unexpected configuration changes. Use these logs to monitor when a member creates, updates, or deletes configurations in your [Zero Trust organization](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/setup/#create-a-zero-trust-organization).

To view admin activity logs, log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and go to **Zero Trust** \> **Insights** \> **Logs** \> **Admin activity logs**.
