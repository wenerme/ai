## What's New

GPT-5.4, GPT-5.4 Pro, and GPT-5.3 Codex introduce the
`phase` field on
assistant messages. This field is critical for multi-turn
agentic workflows — it tells the model whether an assistant
message is intermediate commentary or the final answer.

OpenRouter supports `phase` in both the
[Responses API](/docs/api/api-reference/responses/create-responses)
and the
[Chat Completions API](/docs/api/api-reference/chat/send-chat-completion-request).

## The `phase` Field

`phase` appears on assistant output messages and has three
possible values:

| Value            | Meaning                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `null`           | No phase specified (default)   |
| `"commentary"`   | Intermediate assistant message |
| `"final_answer"` | The final closeout message     |

<Note>
  `phase` is only valid on **assistant** messages.
  Do not add `phase` to user or system messages.
</Note>

## Why It Matters

For models like `gpt-5.3-codex`, `gpt-5.4`, and
`gpt-5.4-pro`, correctly
preserving `phase` on assistant messages is **required**
for optimal performance. If `phase` metadata is dropped
when reconstructing conversation history, significant
performance degradation can occur — including early
stopping on longer-running tasks.

## Usage

### Responses API

When using the Responses API, assistant output items
include `phase`. You must persist these items verbatim
and pass them back in subsequent requests.

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-5.4",
  "input": [
    {
      "type": "message",
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "input_text",
          "text": "Refactor the auth module"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The response will include `phase` on assistant output
messages:

```json
{
  "output": [
    {
      "type": "message",
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "output_text",
          "text": "I'll start by analyzing..."
        }
      ],
      "phase": "commentary"
    },
    {
      "type": "message",
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "output_text",
          "text": "Here's the refactored code..."
        }
      ],
      "phase": "final_answer"
    }
  ]
}
```

For follow-up requests, include the assistant output
items with their `phase` intact:

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-5.4",
  "input": [
    {
      "type": "message",
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "input_text",
          "text": "Refactor the auth module"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "message",
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "output_text",
          "text": "I'll start by analyzing..."
        }
      ],
      "phase": "commentary"
    },
    {
      "type": "message",
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "output_text",
          "text": "Here's the refactored code..."
        }
      ],
      "phase": "final_answer"
    },
    {
      "type": "message",
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "input_text",
          "text": "Now add unit tests"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Chat Completions API

`phase` is also supported in the Chat Completions API.
It appears in assistant messages in both request and
response:

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-5.4",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Refactor the auth module"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I'll start by analyzing...",
      "phase": "commentary"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Here's the refactored code...",
      "phase": "final_answer"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Now add unit tests"
    }
  ]
}
```

In streaming responses, `phase` appears on each delta
chunk:

```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "delta": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Let me write...",
        "phase": "final_answer"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Pattern

When building an integration, persist your conversation
transcript verbatim, including `phase` on assistant
items:

```typescript
type Phase = null | "commentary" | "final_answer";

interface StoredMessage {
  role: "user" | "assistant" | "system";
  content: string;
  phase?: Phase; // Only present on assistant messages
}
```

### Key Rules

1. **Preserve phase on assistant messages** — When you
   receive a response with `phase`, store it and send
   it back on subsequent requests.
2. **Do not add phase to user messages** — `phase` is
   only valid on assistant messages. The Responses API
   will reject requests with `phase` on user messages.
3. **Do not drop phase** — Omitting `phase` from
   assistant messages in multi-turn conversations will
   degrade model performance.

## Supported Models

| Model                  | `phase` Support                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `openai/gpt-5.4`       | Supported                       |
| `openai/gpt-5.4-pro`   | Supported                       |
| `openai/gpt-5.3-codex` | Supported                       |
| Other OpenAI models    | Silently ignored (safe to pass) |
| Non-OpenAI models      | Not applicable                  |

<Note>
  Passing `phase` to OpenAI models that don't support it
  (like `gpt-4o`) is safe — OpenAI silently ignores the
  field. You do not need to filter `phase` based on the
  model.
</Note>

## Breaking Changes

None. The `phase` field is additive:

* Existing requests without `phase` continue to work
  on all models
* Models that don't support `phase` silently ignore it
* No changes are required unless you want to take
  advantage of improved multi-turn performance with
  GPT-5.3 Codex, GPT-5.4, and GPT-5.4 Pro
