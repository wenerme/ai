You can incorporate relevant web search results for *any* model on OpenRouter by activating and customizing the `web` plugin, or by appending `:online` to the model slug:

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-5.2:online"
}
```

You can also append `:online` to `:free` model variants like so:

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-oss-20b:free:online"
}
```

<Note>
  Using web search will incur extra costs, even with free models. See the [pricing section](#pricing) below for details.
</Note>

`:online` is a shortcut for using the `web` plugin, and is exactly equivalent to:

```json
{
  "model": "openrouter/auto",
  "plugins": [{ "id": "web" }]
}
```

The web search plugin is powered by native search for Anthropic, OpenAI, Perplexity, and xAI models.

<Note>
  For xAI models, the web search plugin enables both Web Search and X Search.
</Note>

For other models, the web search plugin is powered by [Exa](https://exa.ai). It uses their ["auto"](https://docs.exa.ai/reference/how-exa-search-works#combining-neural-and-keyword-the-best-of-both-worlds-through-exa-auto-search) method (a combination of keyword search and embeddings-based web search) to find the most relevant results and augment/ground your prompt.

## Parsing web search results

Web search results for all models (including native-only models like Perplexity and OpenAI Online) are available in the API and standardized by OpenRouter to follow the same annotation schema in the [OpenAI Chat Completion Message type](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/object):

```json
{
  "message": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Here's the latest news I found: ...",
    "annotations": [
      {
        "type": "url_citation",
        "url_citation": {
          "url": "https://www.example.com/web-search-result",
          "title": "Title of the web search result",
          "content": "Content of the web search result", // Added by OpenRouter if available
          "start_index": 100, // The index of the first character of the URL citation in the message.
          "end_index": 200 // The index of the last character of the URL citation in the message.
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Customizing the Web Plugin

The maximum results allowed by the web plugin and the prompt used to attach them to your message stream can be customized:

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-5.2:online",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "id": "web",
      "engine": "exa", // Optional: "native", "exa", or undefined
      "max_results": 1, // Defaults to 5
      "search_prompt": "Some relevant web results:" // See default below
    }
  ]
}
```

By default, the web plugin uses the following search prompt, using the current date:

```
A web search was conducted on `date`. Incorporate the following web search results into your response.

IMPORTANT: Cite them using markdown links named using the domain of the source.
Example: [nytimes.com](https://nytimes.com/some-page).
```

## Engine Selection

The web search plugin supports the following options for the `engine` parameter:

* **`native`**: Always uses the model provider's built-in web search capabilities
* **`exa`**: Uses Exa's search API for web results
* **`undefined` (not specified)**: Uses native search if available for the provider, otherwise falls back to Exa

### Default Behavior

When the `engine` parameter is not specified:

* **Native search is used by default** for OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and xAI models that support it
* **Exa search is used** for all other models or when native search is not supported

When you explicitly specify `"engine": "native"`, it will always attempt to use the provider's native search, even if the model doesn't support it (which may result in an error).

### Forcing Engine Selection

You can explicitly specify which engine to use:

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-5.2",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "id": "web",
      "engine": "native"
    }
  ]
}
```

Or force Exa search even for models that support native search:

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-5.2",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "id": "web",
      "engine": "exa",
      "max_results": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

### Engine-Specific Pricing

* **Native search**: Pricing is passed through directly from the provider (see provider-specific pricing info below)
* **Exa search**: Uses OpenRouter credits at \$4 per 1000 results (default 5 results = \$0.02 per request)

## Pricing

### Exa Search Pricing

When using Exa search (either explicitly via `"engine": "exa"` or as fallback), the web plugin uses your OpenRouter credits and charges *\$4 per 1000 results*. By default, `max_results` set to 5, this comes out to a maximum of \$0.02 per request, in addition to the LLM usage for the search result prompt tokens.

### Native Search Pricing (Provider Passthrough)

Some models have built-in web search. These models charge a fee based on the search context size, which determines how much search data is retrieved and processed for a query.

### Search Context Size Thresholds

Search context can be 'low', 'medium', or 'high' and determines how much search context is retrieved for a query:

* **Low**: Minimal search context, suitable for basic queries
* **Medium**: Moderate search context, good for general queries
* **High**: Extensive search context, ideal for detailed research

### Specifying Search Context Size

You can specify the search context size in your API request using the `web_search_options` parameter:

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4.1",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
    }
  ],
  "web_search_options": {
    "search_context_size": "high"
  }
}
```

<Note title="Native Web Search Pricing">
  Refer to each provider's documentation for their native web search pricing info:

  * [OpenAI Pricing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing#built-in-tools)
  * [Anthropic Pricing](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool#usage-and-pricing)
  * [Perplexity Pricing](https://docs.perplexity.ai/getting-started/pricing)
  * [xAI Pricing](https://docs.x.ai/docs/models#tool-invocation-costs)

  Native web search pricing only applies when using `"engine": "native"` or when native search is used by default for supported models. When using `"engine": "exa"`, the Exa search pricing applies instead.
