[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com) is a fast, open-source columnar database for real-time analytics. OpenRouter can stream traces directly to your ClickHouse database for high-performance analytics and custom dashboards.

## Step 1: Create the traces table

Before connecting OpenRouter, create the `OPENROUTER_TRACES` table in your ClickHouse database. You can find the exact SQL in the OpenRouter dashboard when configuring the destination:

![ClickHouse Setup Instructions](https://files.buildwithfern.com/openrouter.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/5c24c1cafb5b6b4fade072d9624cb8f997a997de69f01dbe26e097d90938f488/content/pages/features/broadcast/broadcast-clickhouse-setup.png)

## Step 2: Set up permissions

Ensure your ClickHouse user has CREATE TABLE permissions:

```sql
GRANT CREATE TABLE ON your_database.* TO your_database_user;
```

## Step 3: Enable Broadcast in OpenRouter

Go to [Settings > Observability](https://openrouter.ai/settings/observability) and toggle **Enable Broadcast**.

![Enable Broadcast](https://files.buildwithfern.com/openrouter.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/3e095d95758bab05594f468011be81b7d5a2fb19293fa91d5b3923d9f09b81d8/content/pages/features/broadcast/broadcast-enable.png)

## Step 4: Configure ClickHouse

Click the edit icon next to **ClickHouse** and enter:

![ClickHouse Configuration](https://files.buildwithfern.com/openrouter.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/7cb1f2b37ea07e292bcce47af9c7667b44e4fa45becf4795e0d73ac0d98da03f/content/pages/features/broadcast/broadcast-clickhouse-config.png)

* **Host**: Your ClickHouse HTTP endpoint (e.g., `https://clickhouse.example.com:8123`)
* **Database**: Target database name (default: `default`)
* **Table**: Table name (default: `OPENROUTER_TRACES`)
* **Username**: ClickHouse username for authentication (defaults to `default`)
* **Password**: ClickHouse password for authentication

<Tip>
  For ClickHouse Cloud, your host URL is typically `https://{instance}.{region}.clickhouse.cloud:8443`. You can find this in your ClickHouse Cloud console [under **Connect**](https://clickhouse.com/docs/cloud/guides/sql-console/gather-connection-details).
</Tip>

## Step 5: Test and save

Click **Test Connection** to verify the setup. The configuration only saves if the test passes.

## Step 6: Send a test trace

Make an API request through OpenRouter and query your ClickHouse table to verify the trace was received.

## Example queries

### Cost analysis by model

```sql
SELECT
  toDate(TIMESTAMP) as day,
  MODEL,
  sum(TOTAL_COST) as total_cost,
  sum(TOTAL_TOKENS) as total_tokens,
  count() as request_count
FROM OPENROUTER_TRACES
WHERE TIMESTAMP >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
  AND STATUS = 'ok'
  AND SPAN_TYPE = 'GENERATION'
GROUP BY day, MODEL
ORDER BY day DESC, total_cost DESC;
```

### User activity analysis

```sql
SELECT
  USER_ID,
  uniqExact(TRACE_ID) as trace_count,
  uniqExact(SESSION_ID) as session_count,
  sum(TOTAL_TOKENS) as total_tokens,
  sum(TOTAL_COST) as total_cost,
  avg(DURATION_MS) as avg_duration_ms
FROM OPENROUTER_TRACES
WHERE TIMESTAMP >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
  AND SPAN_TYPE = 'GENERATION'
GROUP BY USER_ID
ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
```

### Error analysis

```sql
SELECT
  TRACE_ID,
  TIMESTAMP,
  MODEL,
  LEVEL,
  FINISH_REASON,
  METADATA,
  INPUT,
  OUTPUT
FROM OPENROUTER_TRACES
WHERE STATUS = 'error'
  AND TIMESTAMP >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
ORDER BY TIMESTAMP DESC;
```

### Provider performance comparison

```sql
SELECT
  PROVIDER_NAME,
  MODEL,
  avg(DURATION_MS) as avg_duration_ms,
  quantile(0.5)(DURATION_MS) as p50_duration_ms,
  quantile(0.95)(DURATION_MS) as p95_duration_ms,
  count() as request_count
FROM OPENROUTER_TRACES
WHERE TIMESTAMP >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
  AND STATUS = 'ok'
  AND SPAN_TYPE = 'GENERATION'
GROUP BY PROVIDER_NAME, MODEL
HAVING request_count >= 10
ORDER BY avg_duration_ms;
```

### Usage by API key

```sql
SELECT
  API_KEY_NAME,
  uniqExact(TRACE_ID) as trace_count,
  sum(TOTAL_COST) as total_cost,
  sum(PROMPT_TOKENS) as prompt_tokens,
  sum(COMPLETION_TOKENS) as completion_tokens
FROM OPENROUTER_TRACES
WHERE TIMESTAMP >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
  AND SPAN_TYPE = 'GENERATION'
GROUP BY API_KEY_NAME
ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
```

### Accessing JSON columns

ClickHouse stores JSON data as strings. Use `JSONExtract` functions to query
nested fields:

```sql
SELECT
  TRACE_ID,
  JSONExtractString(METADATA, 'custom_field') as custom_value,
  JSONExtractString(ATTRIBUTES, 'gen_ai.request.model') as requested_model
FROM OPENROUTER_TRACES
WHERE JSONHas(METADATA, 'custom_field');
```

To parse input messages:

```sql
SELECT
  TRACE_ID,
  JSONExtractString(
    JSONExtractRaw(INPUT, 'messages'),
    1, 'role'
  ) as first_message_role,
  JSONExtractString(
    JSONExtractRaw(INPUT, 'messages'),
    1, 'content'
  ) as first_message_content
FROM OPENROUTER_TRACES
WHERE SPAN_TYPE = 'GENERATION'
LIMIT 10;
```

## Schema design

### Typed columns

The schema extracts commonly-queried fields as typed columns for efficient filtering and aggregation:

* **Identifiers**: TRACE\_ID, USER\_ID, SESSION\_ID, etc.
* **Timestamps**: DateTime64 for time-series analysis with millisecond precision
* **Model Info**: For cost and performance analysis
* **Metrics**: Tokens and costs for billing

### String columns for JSON

Less commonly-accessed and variable-structure data is stored as JSON strings:

* **ATTRIBUTES**: Full OTEL attribute set
* **INPUT/OUTPUT**: Variable message structures
* **METADATA**: User-defined key-values
* **MODEL\_PARAMETERS**: Model-specific configurations

Use ClickHouse's `JSONExtract*` functions to query these fields.

## Custom Metadata

Custom metadata from the `trace` field is stored in the `METADATA` column as a JSON string. You can query it using ClickHouse's `JSONExtract` functions.

### Supported Metadata Keys

| Key               | ClickHouse Mapping                  | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `trace_id`        | `TRACE_ID` column / `METADATA` JSON | Custom trace identifier for grouping |
| `trace_name`      | `METADATA` JSON                     | Custom name for the trace            |
| `span_name`       | `METADATA` JSON                     | Name for intermediate spans          |
| `generation_name` | `METADATA` JSON                     | Name for the LLM generation          |

### Example

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Analyze these metrics..." }],
  "user": "user_12345",
  "session_id": "session_abc",
  "trace": {
    "trace_name": "Metrics Analysis Pipeline",
    "generation_name": "Analyze Trends",
    "team": "data-engineering",
    "pipeline_version": "2.0",
    "data_source": "clickhouse_metrics"
  }
}
```

### Querying Custom Metadata

Use ClickHouse's JSON functions to query your custom metadata:

```sql
SELECT
  TRACE_ID,
  JSONExtractString(METADATA, 'team') as team,
  JSONExtractString(METADATA, 'pipeline_version') as pipeline_version,
  JSONExtractString(METADATA, 'data_source') as data_source,
  TOTAL_COST,
  TOTAL_TOKENS
FROM OPENROUTER_TRACES
WHERE JSONHas(METADATA, 'team')
  AND SPAN_TYPE = 'GENERATION'
ORDER BY TIMESTAMP DESC;
```

### Additional Context

* The `user` field maps to the `USER_ID` typed column
* The `session_id` field maps to the `SESSION_ID` typed column
* All custom metadata keys from `trace` are stored in the `METADATA` JSON string column
* For high-performance filtering on metadata fields, consider creating materialized columns with `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`

## Privacy Mode

When [Privacy Mode](/docs/guides/features/broadcast#privacy-mode) is enabled for this destination, prompt and completion content is excluded from traces. All other trace data — token usage, costs, timing, model information, and custom metadata — is still sent normally. See [Privacy Mode](/docs/guides/features/broadcast#privacy-mode) for details.
