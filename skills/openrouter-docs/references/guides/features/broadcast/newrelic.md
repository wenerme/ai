[New Relic](https://newrelic.com) is a full-stack observability platform for monitoring applications, infrastructure, and digital experiences.

## Step 1: Get your New Relic license key

In New Relic, navigate to your API keys:

1. Log in to your New Relic account
2. Go to **API Keys** in your account settings
3. Create a new Ingest - License key or copy an existing one

## Step 2: Enable Broadcast in OpenRouter

Go to [Settings > Observability](https://openrouter.ai/settings/observability) and toggle **Enable Broadcast**.

![Enable Broadcast](https://files.buildwithfern.com/openrouter.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/3e095d95758bab05594f468011be81b7d5a2fb19293fa91d5b3923d9f09b81d8/content/pages/features/broadcast/broadcast-enable.png)

## Step 3: Configure New Relic

Click the edit icon next to **New Relic** and enter:

* **License Key**: Your New Relic ingest license key
* **Region**: Select your New Relic region (`us` or `eu`)

## Step 4: Test and save

Click **Test Connection** to verify the setup. The configuration only saves if the test passes.

## Step 5: Send a test trace

Make an API request through OpenRouter and view the trace in New Relic's
distributed tracing view.

## Custom Metadata

New Relic receives traces via the OTLP protocol. Custom metadata from the `trace` field is sent as span attributes.

### Supported Metadata Keys

| Key               | New Relic Mapping | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `trace_id`        | Trace ID          | Group multiple requests into a single trace      |
| `trace_name`      | Span Name         | Custom name for the root span                    |
| `span_name`       | Span Name         | Name for intermediate spans in the hierarchy     |
| `generation_name` | Span Name         | Name for the LLM generation span                 |
| `parent_span_id`  | Parent Span ID    | Link to an existing span in your trace hierarchy |

### Example

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Summarize this report..." }],
  "user": "user_12345",
  "session_id": "session_abc",
  "trace": {
    "trace_id": "workflow_789",
    "trace_name": "Report Processing",
    "generation_name": "Summarize Report",
    "environment": "production",
    "service": "report-api"
  }
}
```

### Viewing in New Relic

In New Relic's distributed tracing view, you can:

* Filter traces by custom attributes using NRQL queries
* View custom metadata in the span attributes panel
* Create alerts and dashboards based on metadata fields

### Additional Context

* Custom metadata keys from `trace` are included as span attributes under the `trace.metadata.*` namespace
* The `user` field maps to `user.id` in span attributes
* The `session_id` field maps to `session.id` in span attributes
* GenAI semantic conventions (`gen_ai.*` attributes) are used for model, token, and cost data

## Privacy Mode

When [Privacy Mode](/docs/guides/features/broadcast#privacy-mode) is enabled for this destination, prompt and completion content is excluded from traces. All other trace data — token usage, costs, timing, model information, and custom metadata — is still sent normally. See [Privacy Mode](/docs/guides/features/broadcast#privacy-mode) for details.
