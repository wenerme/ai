# Advisor

> Consult a stronger model mid-generation as a server tool

export const API_KEY_REF = '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>';

<Note>
  **Beta**

  Server tools are currently in beta. The API and behavior may change.
</Note>

The `openrouter:advisor` server tool lets a model consult a higher-intelligence **advisor model** mid-generation. When your model hits a decision point — before committing to an approach, when it's stuck, or before declaring a task done — it invokes the tool with a `prompt`. The advisor model thinks, returns its guidance as the tool result, and your model continues, informed by the advice.

Unlike a fixed model pairing, the advisor can be **any OpenRouter model**, and it can optionally run as a **sub-agent with its own tools** (for example `openrouter:web_search`). The tool returns the advisor model's response directly as the tool result — your model writes the final answer.

You can offer the model a choice of **several named advisors** by including multiple `openrouter:advisor` entries in the `tools` array — one per advisor (see [Multiple advisors](#multiple-advisors)). At most one entry may omit `name` to act as the default advisor.

Each advisor also **remembers its own prior consultations across requests** when you replay the conversation transcript (see [Cross-request memory](#cross-request-memory)), and the tool is available on the Chat Completions, Responses, and Anthropic Messages APIs (see [Anthropic Messages API](#anthropic-messages-api)).

## Quick start

<Template
  data={{
API_KEY_REF,
MODEL: 'openai/gpt-4o-mini',
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript" expandable lines theme={null}
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: 'Build a concurrent worker pool in Go with graceful shutdown.',
          },
        ],
        tools: [
          {
            type: 'openrouter:advisor',
            parameters: { model: '~anthropic/claude-opus-latest' },
          },
        ],
      }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data.choices[0].message.content);
    ```

    ```python title="Python" expandable lines theme={null}
    import requests

    response = requests.post(
      "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
      headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      json={
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Build a concurrent worker pool in Go with graceful shutdown.",
          },
        ],
        "tools": [
          {
            "type": "openrouter:advisor",
            "parameters": {"model": "~anthropic/claude-opus-latest"},
          },
        ],
      },
    )
    print(response.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

## Choosing the advisor model

The advisor model is resolved with the following precedence:

1. `parameters.model` on the tool definition, if set.
2. The `model` argument the executor passes in the tool **call**, if the
   definition does not fix one.
3. The model from the outer API request, as a fallback.

This lets you either pin the advisor model up front (`parameters.model`) or let the executing model pick it per call. The advisor tool itself can never be the advisor model.

## When does the model invoke it?

The tool's description steers the model to consult the advisor before substantive work, when it's stuck, or before declaring a task done — not for trivial steps a single model can resolve directly. To **force** a consultation on every request, set `tool_choice: "required"` (with multiple advisors this forces the first entry — see [Multiple advisors](#multiple-advisors)).

## Parameters

Pass an optional `parameters` object on the tool entry:

```json lines theme={null}
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "openrouter:advisor",
      "parameters": {
        "model": "~anthropic/claude-opus-latest",
        "instructions": "You are a senior staff engineer. Be decisive.",
        "tools": [{ "type": "openrouter:web_search" }],
        "forward_transcript": false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field                   | Default                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                  | None (default advisor) | Optional name for this advisor. The model sees one tool per named advisor (plus one default for an entry with no `name`). Names must be unique across entries. Letters, digits, spaces, underscores, and dashes; trimmed; 1–64 chars. See [Multiple advisors](#multiple-advisors). |
| `model`                 | Outer request model    | The advisor model to consult (any OpenRouter model). See [Choosing the advisor model](#choosing-the-advisor-model).                                                                                                                                                                |
| `tools`                 | None                   | Tools made available to the advisor sub-agent. Only OpenRouter server tools (such as `openrouter:web_search`) are supported; function tools are rejected with a `400` because the advisor has no way to execute them. The advisor may not list itself.                             |
| `instructions`          | None                   | System instructions for the advisor sub-agent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `forward_transcript`    | `false`                | When `true`, the full parent conversation is forwarded to the advisor (and the tool-call `prompt`, if given, is appended as a final user turn). When `false`, the advisor sees only the `prompt`.                                                                                  |
| `stream`                | `false`                | When `true`, the advice streams incrementally as it is produced (Responses API only). See [Streaming advice](#streaming-advice).                                                                                                                                                   |
| `max_tool_calls`        | Provider default       | Max tool-calling steps the advisor sub-agent may take. Only relevant when the advisor has tools. Range 1–25.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `max_completion_tokens` | Provider default       | Max output tokens (including reasoning) for the advisor call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `reasoning`             | Provider default       | Reasoning config forwarded to the advisor call — an object with optional `effort` and `max_tokens`.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `temperature`           | Provider default       | Sampling temperature (`0`–`2`) forwarded to the advisor call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Tool-call arguments

When invoking the tool, the model passes:

| Argument | Description                                                                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prompt` | What the model wants advice on. Required unless `forward_transcript` is `true`.         |
| `model`  | The advisor model to use. Only honored when the tool definition does not fix a `model`. |

## Multiple advisors

To offer the model a choice of advisors, include **multiple `openrouter:advisor` entries** in the `tools` array — one per advisor. Give each its own `name` (plus its own `model`, `instructions`, and the other advisor fields); the model sees one distinct tool per named advisor and calls whichever fits the task:

```json lines theme={null}
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "openrouter:advisor",
      "parameters": {
        "name": "reviewer",
        "model": "~anthropic/claude-opus-latest",
        "instructions": "You are a critical code reviewer. Find the flaws."
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "openrouter:advisor",
      "parameters": {
        "name": "architect",
        "model": "~openai/gpt-latest",
        "instructions": "You are a systems architect. Think about scale."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules for advisor entries:

* **At most one entry may omit `name`** — it becomes the default advisor. Two or more unnamed advisor entries fail the request with a `400`: *"Only one advisor tool can serve as the default. All other advisor tools must have a name defined."*
* **Names must be unique** across entries (compared after trimming whitespace). A duplicate name fails the request with a `400`.
* Names allow **letters, digits, spaces, underscores, and dashes** (e.g. `"Lead Architect"`), are trimmed, and must be 1–64 characters.

A single advisor is just one entry — name it, or leave `name` off to keep it as the default. Each advisor's result reports the model it consulted, so you can tell the advisors apart in the response.

<Note>
  **tool\_choice and named advisors**

  Forcing the advisor with `tool_choice` (e.g. `tool_choice: "required"`, or selecting the `openrouter:advisor` tool) targets the **first** advisor entry. Forcing a specific named advisor via `tool_choice` is not yet supported.
</Note>

## Cross-request memory

Each advisor remembers its own prior `prompt → advice` exchanges **across API requests** in a conversation. When you send a follow-up request that replays the prior transcript — assistant messages with their advisor tool calls and results included, as returned by the API — the advisor sees its earlier consultations replayed into its context before the new prompt. Tell the advisor a fact in one request, and it can recall it in the next without the executor restating it.

This works on all three APIs; the only requirement is that you **replay the advisor exchanges you received**:

* **Chat Completions**: include the assistant message's advisor `tool_calls` and the paired `role: "tool"` result messages from prior turns.
* **Responses API**: include the `openrouter:advisor` output items from prior responses in `input`, unchanged.
* **Anthropic Messages API**: include the assistant message's advisor `server_tool_use` and `advisor_tool_result` content blocks from prior turns.

Memory is **per advisor**: in a multi-advisor setup, each advisor recalls only its own prior exchanges — a "reviewer" advisor never sees what the "architect" was told. There is no fixed limit on the number of replayed exchanges; if the history exceeds the advisor model's context window, it is compressed with the [middle-out transform](/docs/guides/features/message-transforms), which trims the middle of the conversation and keeps the oldest and newest exchanges.

Memory applies to prompt-mode consultations. With `forward_transcript: true` the advisor already sees the full parent conversation, so prior exchanges are not separately replayed.

<Note>
  **Keep advisor entry order stable**

  Advisor identity is positional — derived from the entry's index in the request `tools` array. Keep the order of advisor entries stable across the requests of a conversation (and echo the `instance_name` field on replayed Responses items unchanged). Reordering or inserting advisor entries between requests shifts identities, and each advisor reconstructs another's memory.
</Note>

## Streaming advice

By default the advice arrives only once the advisor has finished — as a single tool result. Set `parameters.stream` to `true` to have the advice stream out incrementally as the advisor model produces it:

```json lines theme={null}
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "openrouter:advisor",
      "parameters": {
        "model": "~anthropic/claude-opus-latest",
        "stream": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In the **Responses API**, the advisor's output item then emits `response.output_text.delta` events as the advice is generated, followed by a `response.output_text.done` and the completed item. The completed item still carries the full `advice` string, so consumers that don't read the deltas are unaffected. `stream` can be set per advisor entry, so you can stream some advisors and not others.

The streamed deltas mirror how a normal assistant message streams text — the `item_id` on each delta is the advisor output item's id.

Streaming has **no effect on the Chat Completions API** (the advice arrives only as the final tool result regardless of `stream`). Streaming the advice in the **Anthropic Messages API** is a planned fast-follow; today a Messages request behaves as if `stream` were `false`.

## What the tool returns

On success the tool result contains the advice text and the model that produced it:

```json lines theme={null}
{
  "status": "ok",
  "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4.8",
  "advice": "Use a channel-based coordination pattern. Close the input channel first, then wait on a WaitGroup to drain in-flight work before shutdown..."
}
```

On failure the result has `status: "error"` with a message; the calling model continues without the advice:

```json lines theme={null}
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Advisor call failed: ..."
}
```

## Anthropic Messages API

On `/api/v1/messages`, request the advisor with the native Anthropic tool shape — and it works with **any executor model**, not just Anthropic ones:

```json lines theme={null}
{
  "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5",
  "max_tokens": 1024,
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "Build a concurrent worker pool in Go with graceful shutdown." }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "advisor_20260301",
      "name": "advisor",
      "model": "~anthropic/claude-opus-latest"
    }
  ]
}
```

The response carries the advisor consultation as the official Anthropic block shapes — a `server_tool_use` block with `name: "advisor"` for the call, followed by an `advisor_tool_result` block with the advice:

```json lines theme={null}
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "server_tool_use",
      "id": "srvtoolu_01abc",
      "name": "advisor",
      "input": { "prompt": "..." }
    },
    {
      "type": "advisor_tool_result",
      "tool_use_id": "srvtoolu_01abc",
      "content": { "type": "advisor_result", "text": "Use a channel-based coordination pattern..." }
    },
    { "type": "text", "text": "..." }
  ]
}
```

Replay these blocks unchanged on the assistant message of follow-up requests for [cross-request memory](#cross-request-memory).

Notes on the native shape:

* `model` is the only advisor configuration the native shape carries. For `instructions`, sub-agent `tools`, `forward_transcript`, and the other [parameters](#parameters), use the `openrouter:advisor` form on Chat Completions or Responses.
* `max_uses` is not honored: consultations are capped per request by OpenRouter's fixed limit, and a `max_uses` below that limit does not lower it. `caching`, `allowed_callers`, and `defer_loading` are also ignored.
* Forcing the advisor via `tool_choice: { "type": "tool", "name": "advisor" }` is supported.

## Sub-agent tools

When you pass `tools`, the advisor runs as an agentic sub-agent over them before producing its advice — for example, giving the advisor `openrouter:web_search` lets it ground its guidance in fresh sources. The advisor's tool use happens inside the tool call; only its final text is returned to your model.

Nested tools must be OpenRouter server tools (for example `openrouter:web_search` or `openrouter:web_fetch`). Function tools (`{ "type": "function" }`) are rejected with a `400`: the advisor call has no client-side executor, so a function tool call could never be fulfilled.

## Recursion protection

The advisor tool cannot invoke itself. Two guards enforce this:

* A self-reference check rejects an advisor entry inside the advisor's own `tools` array (and rejects the advisor tool name as the advisor `model`).
* Each inner advisor call carries an `x-openrouter-advisor-depth` header; the advisor tool is stripped from any sub-call, so an advisor sub-agent can never re-enter the advisor.

Consultations are also capped per request to bound cost and latency.
