# Workload Identity Federation

> Call OpenRouter from workloads signed in with your own identity provider, without long-lived API keys

Workload identity federation lets a workload that already holds a JWT from your identity provider call OpenRouter without an OpenRouter API key in its environment. The workload exchanges its JWT for a short-lived OpenRouter access token ([RFC 8693 token exchange](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693)) and sends that token as the bearer on inference requests.

<Note>
  Workload identity federation is an Enterprise feature. It is available to organizations on Enterprise plans and must be enabled by OpenRouter. Contact your OpenRouter account team, or [contact our enterprise team](https://openrouter.ai/enterprise/form), to enable **Settings → Workload identity** for your organization.
</Note>

## How it works

1. Your identity provider signs a JWT for the workload (a service account, a CI job, a Kubernetes pod).
2. The workload posts that JWT to `POST https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/oauth/token`.
3. OpenRouter verifies the signature against your issuer's published keys, finds the **federation policy** that names the token's `sub` and `aud`, and mints an OpenRouter access token that acts as the API key the policy targets.
4. The workload calls `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/...` with `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` until the token expires, then exchanges again.

Access tokens live for **15 minutes** at most, and never longer than the JWT that was exchanged for them. Usage is attributed to the target API key exactly as if that key had been used directly.

## Set up trust

Everything is configured by an organization admin under **Settings → Workload identity**.

### 1. Add an issuer

An issuer is an identity provider your organization trusts.

| Field               | Meaning                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name                | A label for the settings page.                                                                                                             |
| Issuer URL          | Must equal the `iss` claim of the tokens it signs, exactly. `https://` only.                                                               |
| JWKS URL (optional) | Where the issuer publishes its signing keys. Leave empty and OpenRouter reads `jwks_uri` from `<issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration`. |

### 2. Add a policy

A policy says which tokens from an issuer may exchange, and which API key they act as.

| Field           | Meaning                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Issuer          | The issuer that signs the tokens.                                                                                                 |
| Subject         | Optional. When set, must equal the token's `sub` claim exactly.                                                                   |
| Audience        | Required. Must equal one of the token's `aud` values exactly, so a token the issuer minted for another service is never accepted. |
| Condition       | Optional. A [CEL](https://cel.dev) expression that must evaluate to `true` (see below).                                           |
| Acts as API key | A workspace API key owned by your organization. Personal keys and management keys cannot be targeted.                             |

A policy must set at least one of Subject or Condition. Each policy has an id shown under its name. Your workload sends that id as `federation_policy_id` with every exchange, which binds the exchange to your organization even if another organization trusts the same issuer, subject, and audience. Policies can be paused with the **Enabled** switch.

Under **Token must match**, choose **Add claim check** to add either of these optional conditions:

| Check                           | Required subject-token claim                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scopes                          | `scopes` must be an array of strings containing the exact configured value. A space-separated `scope` string is not used.   |
| Token type (`token_type` claim) | `token_type` must be a string equal to the configured value, such as `service_account`. This is not the JWT header's `typ`. |

All added checks must pass, in addition to issuer, subject, audience, signature, and expiry validation. Matching is case-sensitive; missing or incorrectly typed claims fail the exchange. Each check can be added once and removed independently. Policies without additional checks keep their existing behavior.

These conditions validate the **incoming identity token**. They do not change the `inference` scope or `Bearer` token type of the issued OpenRouter access token, and sending `scope=inference` in the exchange request does not satisfy a subject-token check.

### Conditions

When an exact subject is too narrow, write a **Condition** in [CEL](https://cel.dev). It is evaluated after signature, expiry, exact subject and audience, and claim checks pass, and it sees only these variables from the verified token:

| Variable     | Type           | Source claim                                      |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `subject`    | `string`       | `sub`                                             |
| `audience`   | `list<string>` | `aud` (a string `aud` becomes a one-element list) |
| `scopes`     | `list<string>` | `scopes` (empty list when absent)                 |
| `token_type` | `string`       | `token_type` (empty string when absent)           |

```text title="Example conditions" theme={null}
subject.startsWith("repo:acme/")
"inference" in scopes && audience.size() == 1
token_type == "service_account" || subject.endsWith("@ci.acme.dev")
```

The expression is parsed and type-checked when the policy is saved: it must be at most 2,000 characters, use only the variables above, and evaluate to a boolean. `matches()` (regular expressions) is not available. At exchange time, a condition that evaluates to `false`, errors, or receives a token whose `scopes` or `token_type` claim has the wrong type rejects the exchange with `invalid_grant`. Subject tokens whose `sub` or any `aud` value exceeds 512 characters, or whose `scopes` claim has more than 16 entries or an entry longer than 512 characters, are rejected before any rule is evaluated. Comprehension macros (`all`, `exists`, `filter`, `map`, and similar) cannot be nested inside one another.

## Exchange a token

```bash title="Token exchange" theme={null}
curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/oauth/token \
  -d grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange \
  -d subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt \
  -d federation_policy_id="$FEDERATION_POLICY_ID" \
  -d subject_token="$IDP_JWT"
```

```json title="Response" theme={null}
{
  "access_token": "<short-lived JWT>",
  "issued_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 900,
  "scope": "inference"
}
```

Then call the API with the access token as the bearer:

```bash title="Inference with an access token" theme={null}
curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello" }]
  }'
```

The request body is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and must stay under 32 KB; `subject_token` itself is capped at 16 KB. `federation_policy_id` is required and names the policy to evaluate. `requested_token_type` (must be `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token`) and `scope` (must be `inference`) are accepted and optional; `audience` and `resource` are accepted and ignored.

### Requirements on the subject token

* Signed with `ES256` or `RS256` by a key published at the issuer's JWKS.
* Carries `iss`, `sub`, `aud`, and `exp`, and is not expired.
* `iss` equals the issuer URL of the named policy. One `aud` value equals the policy's audience. If the policy sets a subject, `sub` equals it.
* Satisfies every additional claim check and the condition configured on the policy.

### Errors

Errors follow [RFC 6749 §5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-5.2):

| HTTP | `error`                   | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Verifying OpenRouter access tokens

Access tokens are JWTs (`typ: at+jwt`) signed by OpenRouter with `ES256`. The public keys are published at `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/oauth/jwks`. The `sub` of an access token is the `sub` of the exchanged JWT, and `federation_policy_id` and `federation_issuer_id` name the policy and issuer that authorized it, for auditing on your side. OpenRouter does not read them when authorizing a request.

## Revocation

Deleting or pausing a policy, deleting an issuer, or losing the workload identity entitlement stops **new** exchanges immediately. Access tokens already issued remain valid until they expire, which is at most 15 minutes — none of those changes revokes an outstanding token. To cut off inference within that window, disable or delete the API key the policy targets: key state is checked on every request.
