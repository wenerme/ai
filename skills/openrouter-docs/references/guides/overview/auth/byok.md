# BYOK

> Bring your own provider API keys

export const BYOK_PAYG_MONTHLY_LIST_PRICE_THRESHOLD_USD = '$25,000';

export const BYOK_FEE_PERCENTAGE = '5';

export const BYOK_ENTERPRISE_MONTHLY_LIST_PRICE_THRESHOLD_USD = '$200,000';

## Bring your own API Keys

OpenRouter supports both OpenRouter credits and the
option to bring your own provider keys (BYOK).

When you use OpenRouter credits, your rate limits for
each provider are managed by OpenRouter.

Using provider keys enables direct control over rate limits and costs via your provider account.

Your provider keys are securely encrypted and used for all requests routed through the specified provider.

Manage keys in your [workspace BYOK settings](https://openrouter.ai/workspaces/default/byok).

The cost of using custom provider keys on OpenRouter is
**{BYOK_FEE_PERCENTAGE}% of what the same model/provider would cost
normally on OpenRouter** and will be deducted from your OpenRouter
credits. The free allowance is plan-dependent and measured by list-price
inference cost, not request count: Pay-as-you-go includes
{BYOK_PAYG_MONTHLY_LIST_PRICE_THRESHOLD_USD} per month, while Enterprise
includes {BYOK_ENTERPRISE_MONTHLY_LIST_PRICE_THRESHOLD_USD}. See the
[pricing page](https://openrouter.ai/pricing) for details.

### Key Priority and Fallback

Each BYOK key belongs to one of two sections:

* **Prioritized**, attempted in order, before falling
  back to OpenRouter endpoints. Use this section for your
  primary provider keys.
* **Fallback**, tried only after OpenRouter endpoints
  have been attempted, in order. Use this section for
  backup keys you only want used as a last resort.

You can drag keys between sections on the provider
detail page (e.g.
[/workspaces/default/byok/openai](https://openrouter.ai/workspaces/default/byok/openai)).

By default, if all keys in both sections encounter a
rate limit or failure, OpenRouter will fall back to
using shared OpenRouter endpoints.

Each prioritized key has a **Shared capacity fallback**
setting that controls what happens when your key can't
serve a request on that provider, either because the key
failed or because the requested model is outside the
key's **Models** selection (under **This key applies
to**). Shared capacity spends
OpenRouter credits. The three levels, from weakest to
strongest:

* **Use shared capacity** (default): OpenRouter tries
  your key first, then falls back to OpenRouter
  endpoints on failures.
* **Never use shared capacity for models this key applies
  to**: models selected in the key's Models filter
  (which defaults to All) never fall back to OpenRouter
  endpoints on this provider, which may result in rate
  limit errors if your keys are exhausted, but ensures
  those requests go through your account. Models outside
  the filter can still fall back to OpenRouter endpoints
  on this provider.
* **Never use shared capacity for any model on this
  provider**: never spend OpenRouter credits on this
  provider, even for
  models outside the key's Models filter. Requests to
  that provider only run through your keys: if no key
  allows the requested model, or all matching keys fail,
  that provider is skipped instead of falling back to
  OpenRouter endpoints. Other providers can still serve
  the request unless you restrict them (e.g. with
  `provider.only`).

When you have multiple keys for the same provider,
OpenRouter tries them in priority order (see
[Multiple BYOK Keys](#multiple-byok-keys-for-the-same-provider)).
If the first key fails, it falls through to the next
matching key before falling back to shared capacity.

### BYOK with Provider Ordering

When you combine BYOK keys with [provider ordering](/docs/guides/routing/provider-selection#ordering-specific-providers), OpenRouter **always prioritizes BYOK endpoints first**, regardless of where that provider appears in your specified order. After all BYOK endpoints are exhausted, OpenRouter falls back to shared capacity in the order you specified.

This means BYOK keys effectively override your provider ordering for the initial routing attempts. There is currently no way to change this behavior.

For example, if you have BYOK keys for Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, and Anthropic, and you send a request with:

```json lines theme={null}
{
  "provider": {
    "allow_fallbacks": true,
    "order": ["amazon-bedrock", "google-vertex", "anthropic"]
  }
}
```

The routing order will be:

1. Amazon Bedrock (your BYOK key)
2. Google Vertex AI (your BYOK key)
3. Anthropic (your BYOK key)
4. Amazon Bedrock (OpenRouter's shared capacity)
5. Google Vertex AI (OpenRouter's shared capacity)
6. Anthropic (OpenRouter's shared capacity)

#### Partial BYOK with Provider Ordering

If you only have a BYOK key for some of the providers in your order, the BYOK provider is still tried first. For example, if you specify `order: ["amazon-bedrock", "google-vertex"]` but only have a BYOK key for Google Vertex AI:

```json lines theme={null}
{
  "provider": {
    "allow_fallbacks": true,
    "order": ["amazon-bedrock", "google-vertex"]
  }
}
```

The routing order will be:

1. Google Vertex AI (your BYOK key)
2. Amazon Bedrock (OpenRouter's shared capacity)
3. Google Vertex AI (OpenRouter's shared capacity)

Note that even though Amazon Bedrock is listed first in the `order` array, the Google Vertex AI BYOK endpoint takes priority.

If you want to prevent fallback to OpenRouter endpoints
entirely, set **Shared capacity fallback** to **"Never
use shared capacity for any model on this provider"** on your
BYOK keys in your
[workspace BYOK settings](https://openrouter.ai/workspaces/default/byok).

### BYOK with Data Policies

BYOK endpoints are subject to your data policies. Bringing your own key changes which credential authenticates the upstream request. It doesn't change which endpoints you're allowed to route to. Your provider, account, and guardrail data policies are applied **before** BYOK endpoints are created, so BYOK only routes to endpoints that already satisfy them.

This means a BYOK key does not exempt a provider from your [Zero Data Retention](/docs/guides/features/zdr) or `data_collection` restrictions. If you enforce ZDR (via `provider.zdr`, account privacy settings, or a guardrail) and a provider's endpoint retains prompts, that endpoint stays ineligible even when you supply your own key.

For example, if you enforce ZDR and send a request that would otherwise use a BYOK key for a provider whose endpoint retains prompts:

```json lines theme={null}
{
  "provider": {
    "zdr": true
  }
}
```

The retaining endpoint is filtered out before your BYOK key is considered, and the request fails if no ZDR-compliant endpoint remains, even though you have a valid key for that provider.

To use a provider via BYOK, make sure it's permitted by your data policies: the provider's endpoint must satisfy any ZDR or `data_collection` restrictions you've enabled. See [Zero Data Retention](/docs/guides/features/zdr) and [Provider Routing](/docs/guides/routing/provider-selection).

### BYOK and Guardrail Budgets

By default, BYOK inference spend does **not** count toward [guardrail](/docs/guides/features/guardrails) budgets. Only OpenRouter credit spend does. This means a budget limit can appear far from its cap even after significant BYOK usage.

To count BYOK spend toward a guardrail's budget, enable **Include BYOK spend** on the guardrail (or set `include_byok_in_budgets` to `true` via the [management API](/docs/guides/features/guardrails#api-access)). When enabled, the amount OpenRouter would have charged had the request not used your own provider key is added to the budget alongside your credit spend, and the guardrail blocks requests once the combined total reaches the limit.

This toggle is available on all guardrail budgets, including the workspace default guardrail. It has no effect on a guardrail without a budget limit.

### BYOK and Workspace Budgets

[Workspace budgets](/docs/guides/features/workspaces/workspace-budgets) behave the same way and are controlled separately from guardrails. By default BYOK spend does **not** count toward them; enable **Include BYOK spend** in the workspace's Budgets settings, or set `include_byok_in_budgets` to `true` on the workspace budget endpoint.

The workspace setting applies to every interval for that workspace at once (daily, weekly, monthly, and lifetime).

### Multiple BYOK Keys for the Same Provider

You can configure multiple BYOK keys for the same provider. All matching keys are used for routing, and each key produces its own endpoint copy that is pinned to that specific key throughout the request lifecycle.

#### Priority Order

Keys are tried in the order you define, within their
section. Prioritized keys are tried first, then
OpenRouter endpoints, then Fallback keys. You can
reorder keys via drag-and-drop on the provider detail
page (e.g.
[/workspaces/default/byok/openai](https://openrouter.ai/workspaces/default/byok/openai)).
When a key fails (e.g. rate limit or error), OpenRouter
falls through to the next matching key.

For example, if you have three OpenAI keys:

* **Prioritized section**: First key, Second key
* **Fallback section**: Backup key

OpenRouter will try: First key, then Second key,
then OpenRouter endpoints, then Backup key.

#### Key Filters

Each BYOK key supports optional filters (shown as **This key applies to** on the key card) to control when it is used:

* **Model filter**, restrict the key to specific models (e.g. only use this key for `openai/gpt-4o`). When set, the key is only used for requests to the listed models. Other models for the same provider will skip this key.
* **API key filter**, restrict which of your OpenRouter API keys can use this BYOK key. Useful for isolating BYOK usage to specific applications or environments.
* **Member filter**, restrict which workspace members can use this BYOK key. Useful for giving different team members access to different provider accounts.

Filters are evaluated before routing. A key is only used when all of its active filters match the current request. If no filters are set, the key is available to all models, API keys, and members.

#### Managing Filters via the Management API

You can set and update all three filters programmatically using the [BYOK management endpoints](/docs/api/api-reference/byok). The API uses these field names:

| UI filter      | API field                | Type               | Semantics                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Model filter   | `allowed_models`         | `string[] \| null` | Allowlist of model slugs (e.g. `["openai/gpt-4o"]`). `null` means no restriction.                                                    |
| API key filter | `allowed_api_key_hashes` | `string[] \| null` | Allowlist of OpenRouter API key hashes (the `hash` field from the [Keys API](/docs/api/api-reference/keys)). `null` means no restriction. |
| Member filter  | `allowed_user_ids`       | `string[] \| null` | Allowlist of user IDs (Clerk user IDs). `null` means no restriction.                                                                 |

Each field accepts up to 100 entries. Omission and `null` mean different things, and omission itself means something different depending on whether you're creating or updating:

* **Create**: omitting a field means no restriction. Passing an array sets the restriction to those entries.
* **Update**: omitting a field leaves its current value unchanged — whatever restriction (or lack of one) the key already has is preserved. Passing `null` clears a previously set restriction. Passing an array replaces the restriction with those entries.
* An empty array (`[]`) is invalid for `allowed_api_key_hashes` and is rejected with a `400` error — pass `null` to clear the restriction instead, or omit the field to leave it unset (create) or unchanged (update).

**Create a BYOK key with restrictions:**

```bash theme={null}
curl -X POST https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/byok \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_MANAGEMENT_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider": "openai",
    "key": "sk-...",
    "name": "Production GPT-4o Key",
    "allowed_models": ["openai/gpt-4o", "openai/gpt-4o-mini"],
    "allowed_api_key_hashes": ["f01d52606dc8f0a8303a7b5cc3fa07109c2e346cec7c0a16b40de462992ce943"],
    "allowed_user_ids": ["user_2abc123"]
  }'
```

**Update restrictions on an existing key:**

```bash theme={null}
curl -X PATCH https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/byok/11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_MANAGEMENT_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "allowed_api_key_hashes": null
  }'
```

**Read back a key with restrictions:**

```bash theme={null}
curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/byok/11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_MANAGEMENT_KEY"
```

```json theme={null}
{
  "data": {
    "id": "11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555",
    "provider": "openai",
    "workspace_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "label": "sk-...AbCd",
    "name": "Production GPT-4o Key",
    "disabled": false,
    "is_fallback": false,
    "allowed_models": ["openai/gpt-4o", "openai/gpt-4o-mini"],
    "allowed_api_key_hashes": ["f01d52606dc8f0a8303a7b5cc3fa07109c2e346cec7c0a16b40de462992ce943"],
    "allowed_user_ids": ["user_2abc123"],
    "sort_order": 0,
    "created_at": "2025-08-24T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Validation rules for `allowed_api_key_hashes`:**

* Must be an array of strings (the SHA-256 `hash` values returned by the [Keys API](/docs/api/api-reference/keys)).
* Each hash must be exactly 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters. Hashes in any other format are rejected with a `400` error.
* Maximum 100 entries.
* Must contain at least one hash if provided — an empty array (`[]`) is rejected with a `400` error. Pass `null` to clear the restriction instead, or omit the field to leave it unset (create) or unchanged (update).
* Every hash must resolve to a live API key owned by your account; unknown or cross-account hashes return a `400` error.

#### Combining Filters with Multiple Keys

Filters and multiple keys work together to enable flexible routing strategies. For example:

* **Key A**: OpenAI, model filter = `[openai/gpt-4o]`, Shared capacity fallback set to "Never use shared capacity for models this key applies to"
* **Key B**: OpenAI, no model filter (matches all models)

In this setup:

* Requests for `openai/gpt-4o` try **Key A** first, then **Key B** if Key A fails (shared capacity is skipped because Key A covers `openai/gpt-4o` and restricts fallback for the models it covers)
* Requests for other OpenAI models (e.g. `openai/gpt-4o-mini`) use **Key B** only, with shared capacity as fallback

#### Key Names

Each key can be given an optional name (e.g. "Production", "Team A", "GPT-4 only") to help organize keys when you have multiple keys for the same provider.

### Azure API Keys

Azure has two resource types, each using a different domain:

* **Azure AI Foundry**, resources at `*.services.ai.azure.com`. Uses the model catalog and does not require per-model deployments.
* **Azure OpenAI**, resources at `*.openai.azure.com`. Requires explicit per-model deployments.

#### Foundry Configuration (Recommended)

The simplest way to configure Azure BYOK is with a Foundry configuration. Provide your API key, resource name, and resource type:

```json lines theme={null}
[
  {
    "api_key": "your-azure-api-key",
    "resource_name": "your-resource-name",
    "resource_type": "ai_foundry"
  }
]
```

* **`api_key`**: Your Azure API key, found under "Keys and Endpoint" in the Azure portal.
* **`resource_name`**: The name of your Azure resource (the subdomain portion of your endpoint URL).
* **`resource_type`**: Either `"ai_foundry"` for Azure AI Foundry resources (`*.services.ai.azure.com`) or `"openai"` for Azure OpenAI resources (`*.openai.azure.com`). Defaults to `"openai"` if omitted.

This configuration works for all models available in your Azure resource, with no per-model setup required.

#### Per-Deployment Configuration (Legacy)

For more control, you can specify individual deployments with full endpoint URLs:

```json lines theme={null}
[
  {
    "model_slug": "mistralai/mistral-large",
    "endpoint_url": "https://example-project.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/mistral-large/chat/completions?api-version=2024-08-01-preview",
    "api_key": "your-azure-api-key",
    "model_id": "mistral-large"
  },
  {
    "model_slug": "openai/gpt-5.2",
    "endpoint_url": "https://example-project.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-5.2/chat/completions?api-version=2024-08-01-preview",
    "api_key": "your-azure-api-key",
    "model_id": "gpt-5.2"
  }
]
```

Each per-deployment configuration requires:

1. **`endpoint_url`**: The full deployment endpoint URL including `/chat/completions` and the API version. See the [Azure Foundry documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/model-inference/concepts/endpoints?tabs=python) for details.
2. **`api_key`**: Your Azure API key.
3. **`model_id`**: The name of your model deployment in Azure.
4. **`model_slug`**: The OpenRouter model identifier you want to use this key for.

You can mix Foundry and per-deployment configurations in the same array. Per-deployment configs take priority when a matching model slug is found.

### AWS Bedrock API Keys

To use Amazon Bedrock with OpenRouter, you can authenticate using either Bedrock API keys or traditional AWS credentials.

#### Option 1: Bedrock API Keys (Recommended)

Amazon Bedrock API keys provide a simpler authentication method. Simply provide your Bedrock API key as a string:

```lines theme={null}
your-bedrock-api-key-here
```

**Note:** Bedrock API keys are tied to a specific AWS region and cannot be used to change regions. If you need to use models in different regions, use the AWS credentials option below.

You can generate Bedrock API keys in the AWS Management Console. Learn more in the [Amazon Bedrock API keys documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/api-keys.html).

#### Option 2: AWS Credentials

Alternatively, you can use traditional AWS credentials in JSON format. This option allows you to specify the region and provides more flexibility:

```json lines theme={null}
{
  "accessKeyId": "your-aws-access-key-id",
  "secretAccessKey": "your-aws-secret-access-key",
  "region": "your-aws-region"
}
```

You can find these values in your AWS account:

1. **accessKeyId**: This is your AWS Access Key ID. You can create or find your access keys in the AWS Management Console under "Security Credentials" in your AWS account.

2. **secretAccessKey**: This is your AWS Secret Access Key, which is provided when you create an access key.

3. **region**: The AWS region where your Amazon Bedrock models are deployed (e.g., "us-east-1", "us-west-2").

Make sure your AWS IAM user or role has the necessary permissions to access Amazon Bedrock services. At minimum, you'll need permissions for:

* `bedrock:InvokeModel`
* `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream` (for streaming responses)

Example IAM policy:

```json lines theme={null}
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "bedrock:InvokeModel",
        "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

For enhanced security, we recommend creating dedicated IAM users with limited permissions specifically for use with OpenRouter.

Learn more in the [AWS Bedrock Getting Started with the API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started-api.html) documentation, [IAM Permissions Setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/security-iam.html) guide, or the [AWS Bedrock API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/welcome.html).

### Google Vertex API Keys

To use Google Vertex AI with OpenRouter, provide your Google Cloud service account key in JSON format. The key should include the standard Google Cloud service account fields, with an optional `region` for selecting the deployment region.

```json lines theme={null}
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "your-private-key-id",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "universe_domain": "googleapis.com",
  "region": "global"
}
```

You can find these values in your Google Cloud Console:

1. **Service Account Key**: Navigate to the Google Cloud Console, go to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts", select your service account, and create/download a JSON key.

2. **region** (optional): Specify the region for your Vertex AI deployment. Use `"global"` to allow requests to run in any available region, or specify a specific region like `"us-central1"` or `"europe-west1"`.

### Vertex Batch storage

[Batch API](/docs/batch-quickstart) Vertex BYOK stages input and reads Vertex output from a bucket in your own project. The default is bucketless: omit `bucket`, and OpenRouter creates `or-batch-<project>-<region>` on the first batch in each region — uniform bucket-level access, public access prevention, 30-day object lifecycle, soft delete disabled — and reuses it afterwards. Synchronous requests ignore this field.

For production, grant the key service account a custom IAM role at project scope with only the permissions OpenRouter uses:

* `storage.buckets.create`, `storage.buckets.get`, and `storage.buckets.list`;
* `storage.objects.create`, `storage.objects.get`, `storage.objects.list`, and `storage.objects.delete` (delete enables retry-safe overwrite of staged input).

Project scope is required because OpenRouter creates the bucket and verifies project ownership. For the simplest setup, `roles/storage.admin` includes these permissions but also grants additional Storage administration capabilities.

To manage storage yourself, set `bucket` to a bucket name or URI (`"my-batch-bucket"` or `"gs://my-batch-bucket"`; object paths like `"gs://my-batch-bucket/prefix"` are rejected). It must belong to the key's project. OpenRouter leaves location compatibility to Vertex for these user-managed overrides. Grant:

* the key service account: object read/write, bucket get, and bucket list on the project (the list is how OpenRouter verifies ownership);
* the project's Vertex AI service agent (`service-<PROJECT_NUMBER>@gcp-sa-aiplatform.iam.gserviceaccount.com`): object access and bucket metadata access, since Vertex reads input and writes prediction shards as this agent. Create the agent before the first batch if it does not exist yet:

```bash lines theme={null}
gcloud beta services identity create --service=aiplatform.googleapis.com --project=YOUR_PROJECT
```

Make sure your service account has the necessary Vertex AI permissions:

* `aiplatform.endpoints.predict` for synchronous requests
* `aiplatform.batchPredictionJobs.*` for Batch API jobs (OpenRouter uses `create` and `get`)

The example `roles/aiplatform.user` binding below includes these permissions.

Example IAM policy:

```json lines theme={null}
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "role": "roles/aiplatform.user",
      "members": [
        "serviceAccount:your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Learn more in the [Google Cloud Vertex AI documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform) and [Service Account setup guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create).

### Debugging BYOK Issues

If your BYOK requests fail, you can debug the issue by viewing provider responses on the Activity page.

#### Viewing Provider Responses

1. Navigate to your [Activity page](https://openrouter.ai/activity) in the OpenRouter dashboard.
2. Find the generation you want to debug and click on it to view the details.
3. Click "View Raw Metadata" to display the raw metadata in JSON format.
4. In the JSON, look for the `provider_responses` field, which shows the HTTP status code from each provider attempt.

The `provider_responses` field contains an array of responses from each provider attempted during routing. Each entry includes the provider name and HTTP status code, which can help you identify permission issues, rate limits, or other errors.

#### Common BYOK Error Codes

When debugging BYOK issues, look for these common HTTP status codes in the provider responses:

* **400 Bad Request**: The request format was invalid for the provider. Check that your model and key configuration is correct.
* **401 Unauthorized**: Your API key is invalid or has been revoked. Verify your key in your provider's console.
* **403 Forbidden**: Your API key doesn't have permission to access the requested resource. For AWS Bedrock, ensure your IAM policy includes the required `bedrock:InvokeModel` permissions. For Google Vertex, verify your service account has `aiplatform.endpoints.predict` for synchronous requests and the required `aiplatform.batchPredictionJobs.*` permissions for Batch API jobs.
* **429 Too Many Requests**: You've hit the rate limit on your provider account. Check your provider's rate limit settings or wait before retrying.
* **500 Server Error**: The provider encountered an internal error. This is typically a temporary issue on the provider's side.

#### Debugging Permission Issues

If you encounter 403 errors with BYOK, the issue is often related to permissions. For AWS Bedrock, verify that:

1. Your IAM user/role has the `bedrock:InvokeModel` and `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream` permissions.
2. The model you're trying to access is enabled in your AWS account for the specified region.
3. Your credentials (access key and secret) are correct and active.

For Google Vertex, verify that your service account has `aiplatform.endpoints.predict` for synchronous requests and the required `aiplatform.batchPredictionJobs.*` permissions for Batch API jobs.

You can test your provider permissions directly in the provider's console (AWS Console, Google Cloud Console, etc.) by attempting to invoke the model there first.
