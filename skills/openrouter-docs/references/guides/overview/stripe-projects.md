# Stripe Projects

[Stripe Projects](https://projects.dev) is a CLI-based developer tool marketplace that lets you provision production-grade services -- hosting, databases, auth, analytics, AI, and more -- directly from your terminal. OpenRouter is a launch partner, so you can add AI model access to any project with a single command. Browse the full catalog at [projects.dev/providers](https://projects.dev/providers) and read Stripe's docs at [docs.stripe.com/stripe-projects](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-projects).

## Why Use Stripe Projects with OpenRouter?

* **One command to get started** -- `stripe projects add openrouter/api` provisions an OpenRouter account, generates an API key, and syncs it to your `.env` file automatically.
* **Unified billing** -- Manage all your infrastructure costs (hosting, database, AI) through a single Stripe account.
* **Credential management** -- API keys are stored in Stripe's encrypted vault and synced to your local environment. Rotate credentials without touching your codebase.
* **Agent-friendly** -- Stripe Projects writes skill files into your project directory, so coding agents can provision and configure services on your behalf.

## Prerequisites

1. A [Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
2. The [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) installed and up to date
3. The Projects plugin installed:

```bash
stripe plugin install projects
```

## Quick Start

### Browse the catalog

List every provider or filter down to OpenRouter before installing:

```bash
# All providers
stripe projects catalog

# Just OpenRouter's services and plans
stripe projects catalog openrouter
```

You can also browse the web directory at [projects.dev/providers](https://projects.dev/providers).

### Add OpenRouter to your project

If you already have a Stripe project initialized, add OpenRouter in one step:

```bash
stripe projects add openrouter/api
```

This provisions an OpenRouter account (or links your existing one), generates an API key, and syncs OpenRouter's environment variables to your `.env` file. By default the service is provisioned on the **Free** plan -- see [Plans and billing](#plans-and-billing) below to upgrade.

### Start from scratch

If you're starting a new project, initialize it first:

```bash
# Initialize a new Stripe project
stripe projects init my-app

# Add OpenRouter
stripe projects add openrouter/api
```

### Verify your setup

After adding OpenRouter, confirm everything is working:

```bash
# Check project status
stripe projects status

# Test the API key
curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

## What Gets Provisioned

When you run `stripe projects add openrouter/api`, the following happens:

1. **Account creation or linking** -- Stripe Projects finds your OpenRouter account by email or creates a new one automatically. See [Account linking](#account-linking) for details on each path.
2. **API key generation** -- A dedicated API key (`sk-or-v1-...`) is minted and labeled **"Provisioned by Stripe"** so it's easy to identify alongside your other keys at [openrouter.ai/settings/keys](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys).
3. **Environment sync** -- The following variables are stored in Stripe's encrypted vault and written to your project's `.env`:

   ```bash
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
   OPENROUTER_TYPE=bearer
   ```

Your API key works with the full [OpenRouter API](/docs/quickstart), giving you access to 300+ AI models through a single endpoint.

## Service Details

|              |                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Provider** | OpenRouter                                                                     |
| **Service**  | `openrouter/api`                                                               |
| **Category** | AI                                                                             |
| **Plans**    | `free` (no credit card required) or `pay-as-you-go` (per-token usage pricing)  |
| **Pricing**  | Per-token, varies by model. See [model pricing](https://openrouter.ai/models). |

### Choose a plan

`stripe projects add openrouter/api` prompts you to choose between the **Free** and **Pay-as-you-go** plans when you provision. The Free plan works without a payment method. To switch plans later, use `stripe projects upgrade` or `stripe projects downgrade`:

```bash
# Move an existing resource to pay-as-you-go
stripe projects upgrade openrouter/api

# Move back to the free plan
stripe projects downgrade openrouter/api
```

## Managing Your OpenRouter Service

Stripe's `remove` and `rotate` commands accept either the local resource name (e.g. `openrouter-api`) or the `<provider>/<service>` reference. Use `stripe projects services list` to see the exact resource names in your project.

### Rotate credentials

If you need to rotate your API key (for example, after a team member leaves):

```bash
stripe projects rotate openrouter/api
```

This generates a new API key, disables the old one, and updates your `.env` file automatically.

### Remove the service

To remove OpenRouter from your project and revoke the API key:

```bash
stripe projects remove openrouter/api
```

Add `--only-credentials` to forget the local resource without deprovisioning it on OpenRouter's side.

### Sync environment variables

List the project's environment variables (values are hidden):

```bash
stripe projects env
```

If your `.env` file gets out of sync, pull the latest credentials:

```bash
stripe projects env --pull
```

### Open the OpenRouter dashboard

Jump straight to your OpenRouter dashboard from the CLI:

```bash
stripe projects open openrouter
```

## Account Linking

Stripe Projects resolves your OpenRouter account by the email on your Stripe account:

* **No existing OpenRouter account** -- A new account is created inline and credentials are returned directly from the provisioning call. No browser pop-up.
* **Existing OpenRouter account** -- Stripe and OpenRouter complete a headless OAuth 2.0 code exchange (against `POST /api/v1/provisioning/oauth/token`) to link your account. No browser pop-up in the common case.
* **Fallback** -- In rare cases (for example, an idempotent replay before linking completes), you'll be prompted to open a browser to finish authorizing the connection. Once linked, the association persists across projects in the same Stripe account.

## Plans and billing

OpenRouter ships with two plans through Stripe Projects:

* **Free** -- Access free AI models at zero cost. No payment method required.
* **Pay-as-you-go** -- Per-token pricing across 300+ models with no minimum commitment. See [openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models) for rates.

When you choose a paid plan, Stripe tokenizes your Stripe-stored payment credentials into a [Shared Payment Token](https://docs.stripe.com/agentic-commerce/concepts/shared-payment-tokens) and grants OpenRouter a payment credential scoped to that upgrade. Your underlying card/bank details are never shared directly.

Manage your payment method on Stripe's side:

```bash
# View the payment method on file
stripe projects billing show

# Add or update a payment method
stripe projects billing add
```

## Using with Coding Agents

Stripe Projects is designed to work with coding agents. When you initialize a project, Stripe writes skill files into your project directory so agents can provision and manage services using the same deterministic CLI.

Example prompts for your agent:

* *"Add OpenRouter to this project so I can call AI models."*
* *"Rotate my OpenRouter API key."*
* *"What AI services are available in the Stripe Projects catalog?"*

<Tip>
  To avoid browser pop-ups during agent-driven provisioning, complete the following flow manually **before** starting your agent session:

  ```bash
  stripe login
  stripe projects link openrouter
  stripe projects billing add   # only if you plan to use pay-as-you-go
  ```

  Then let the agent call `stripe projects add openrouter/api`.
</Tip>

For fully non-interactive provisioning (CI, scripts, agents), pass `--json --yes`:

```bash
stripe projects add openrouter/api --json --yes
```

To give your agent a combined, up-to-date context document for every provider in your project (including OpenRouter's quickstart, models, and SDK skills), run:

```bash
stripe projects llm-context
```
