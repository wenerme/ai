            Partitioning strategy for sorting: "model" (default) groups
            endpoints by model before sorting (fallback models remain
            fallbacks), "none" sorts all endpoints together regardless of model.
          enum:
            - model
            - none
            - null
          example: model

            - string
            - 'null'
