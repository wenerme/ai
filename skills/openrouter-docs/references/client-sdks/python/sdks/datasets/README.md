### Available Operations

* [get\_app\_rankings](#get_app_rankings) - Top apps by token usage
* [get\_rankings\_daily](#get_rankings_daily) - Daily token totals for top 50 models
* [get\_session\_cost](#get_session_cost) - Cost per session by harness and model

## get\_app\_rankings

Returns the top public apps on OpenRouter ranked by token usage inside the requested
date window, matching the public apps marketplace on openrouter.ai/apps. Token totals
are `prompt_tokens + completion_tokens`; hidden and private apps are excluded and
traffic from related app aliases is merged into the canonical visible app.

`sort=popular` (default) ranks by total token volume inside the window.
`sort=trending` ranks by absolute excess token growth: window volume minus the average
volume of the three equal-length periods immediately preceding the window. Apps with
no excess growth are omitted, so `trending` may return fewer than `limit` rows.

Filter with `category` (marketplace category group, e.g. `coding`) or `subcategory`
(e.g. `cli-agent`). Ranks are re-numbered 1..N after filtering. Page with `offset` —
`rank` stays absolute, so the first row of `offset=50` is `rank: 51`.

Authenticate with any valid OpenRouter API key (same key used for inference).
Rate-limited to 30 requests/minute per key and 500 requests/day per account.

When republishing or quoting this dataset, OpenRouter must be cited as:
"Source: OpenRouter (openrouter.ai/apps), as of \{as\_of}."

Token counts come from each upstream provider's own tokenizer, so a token attributed
to one app is not directly comparable to a token attributed to another app whose
traffic flows through a different provider.

### Example Usage

```python theme={null}
from openrouter import OpenRouter
import os


with OpenRouter(
    http_referer="<value>",
    x_open_router_title="<value>",
    x_open_router_categories="<value>",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY", ""),
) as open_router:

    res = open_router.datasets.get_app_rankings(sort="popular", limit=50, offset=0)

    while res is not None:
        # Handle items

        res = res.next()

```

## get\_rankings\_daily

Returns the top 50 public models per day by total token usage on OpenRouter, plus a
single aggregated `other` row per day that sums every model outside that top 50.
Token totals are `prompt_tokens + completion_tokens`, matching the public rankings
chart on openrouter.ai/rankings.

Each row is a distinct `(date, model_permaslug)` pair. The `other` row uses the
reserved permaslug `other` and is always returned last within its date, so callers
can compute `top-50 traffic / total daily traffic` without a second request.

Optional filters slice the dataset. `period` (`day`/`week`/`month`) sets the time
grain. `modality` and `context_bucket` narrow the exact dataset by output/input
modality (or tool-calling activity) and request context length. `category` and
`language_type` instead read a sampled, upsampled dataset whose `total_tokens` are
weekly-grain estimates — they cannot be combined with each other or with the exact
filters, and reject `period=day` with a 400.

Authenticate with any valid OpenRouter API key (same key used for inference).
Rate-limited to 30 requests/minute per key and 500 requests/day per account.

When republishing or quoting this dataset, OpenRouter must be cited as:
"Source: OpenRouter (openrouter.ai/rankings), as of \{as\_of}."

Token counts come from each upstream provider's own tokenizer (Anthropic counts
are as reported by Anthropic, OpenAI counts are as reported by OpenAI, etc.), so
a token in one row is not directly comparable to a token in another row from a
different provider.

### Example Usage

```python theme={null}
from openrouter import OpenRouter
import os


with OpenRouter(
    http_referer="<value>",
    x_open_router_title="<value>",
    x_open_router_categories="<value>",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY", ""),
) as open_router:

    res = open_router.datasets.get_rankings_daily()

    # Handle response
    print(res)

```

## get\_session\_cost

Returns weekly refreshed, aggregated cost-per-session cells for the published harnesses.
Sessions are never pooled across apps. Medians are of per-session USD spend, and
privacy-preserving aggregation never exposes clerk\_user\_id values or per-session rows.

Filter by `app_slug`, `model`, or `turn_range`. Filtering by `model` alone works across apps
for harness-vs-harness comparison at a fixed model. Results refresh weekly and include the source snapshot
window in `meta`.

### Example Usage

```python theme={null}
from openrouter import OpenRouter
import os


with OpenRouter(
    http_referer="<value>",
    x_open_router_title="<value>",
    x_open_router_categories="<value>",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY", ""),
) as open_router:

    res = open_router.datasets.get_session_cost(limit=100, offset=0)

    while res is not None:
        # Handle items

        res = res.next()

```
