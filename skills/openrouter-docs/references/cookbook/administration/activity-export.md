# Activity Export

Export your aggregated usage data as CSV or PDF from the [Activity page](https://openrouter.ai/activity).

## Overview

The Activity page shows three metrics:

* **Spend**: Total spend (OpenRouter credits + estimated BYOK spend)
* **Tokens**: Total tokens used (prompt + completion)
* **Requests**: Number of AI requests (chatroom included)

Filter by time period (1 Hour, 1 Day, 1 Month, 1 Year) and group by Model, API Key, or Creator (org member). Each time period is sub-grouped by minute, hour, day, and month, respectively.

<Note>
  **Estimated BYOK Spend**

  Dollars spent for external BYOK usage is estimated based on market rates for that provider, and don't reflect any discounts you might have from them.
</Note>

## How to Export

1. Go to [openrouter.ai/activity](https://openrouter.ai/activity)
2. Select your time period and grouping
3. Open the options dropdown (top right)
4. Choose **Export to...** then **CSV** or **PDF**

For example, a detailed "Tokens by API Key" export to pdf for the last year. It starts with a summary page for all keys, and then granular breakdowns for each key individually:
