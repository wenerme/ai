# MCP server

![Abstract image of a drive with Linear's logo and the words "Remote MCP server"](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/54373418b3cb31208f112cd8137d7dd825d1b7c0-3600x1800.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides a standardized interface that allows any compatible AI model or agent to access your Linear data in a simple and secure way.

Connect to our MCP server natively in Claude, Cursor, and other clients or use the   [`mcp-remote`](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote) module for backwards compatibility with clients that do not support remote MCP.

Linear's MCP server follows the authenticated remote [MCP spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26), so the server is centrally hosted and managed. The Linear MCP server has tools available for finding, creating, and updating objects in Linear like issues, projects, and comments — with more functionality on the way, and [feedback](https://linear.app/contact/support) on its functionality is welcomed.

For help getting started after setup, see some of our [example prompts](https://linear.app/docs/mcp#common-use-cases).

## Setup

### General

Our MCP server uses Streamable HTTP as the primary transport, accessible at the following address. The interactive setup flow uses OAuth 2.1 with dynamic client registration. You can also authenticate directly with a bearer token or Linear API key — see the FAQ for details.

 `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp`

If you only want read-only access, use `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp/readonly` instead.

For instructions for specific clients, read on. Dedicated setup pages are also available for [Claude](https://linear.app/integrations/claude), [Cursor](https://linear.app/integrations/cursor-mcp), [VS Code](https://linear.app/integrations/vs-code-mcp), [Windsurf](https://linear.app/integrations/windsurf), and [Zed](https://linear.app/integrations/zed/).

### Claude

**Team, Enterprise (Claude.ai)**

Navigate to the [connectors](https://claude.ai/customize/connectors) page and connect Linear.

**Free, Pro (Claude desktop)**

From Claude settings > Connectors you can add the Linear connector.

#### Enterprise-managed authorization

If you use Okta, first configure SAML for Linear. Then enable **MCP enterprise managed authentication** on your Okta identity provider in Linear and enter the Okta [**Issuer URI**](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa-redirect/-/main/#find-your-config-values) for the authorization server used for MCP authentication, for example:

```json
https://your-org.okta.com/oauth2/default
```

This allows supported external MCP clients such as Claude to authenticate users automatically using your Okta-managed access policies.

### Claude Code

```json
claude mcp add --transport http linear-server https://mcp.linear.app/mcp
```

Then run `/mcp` once you've opened a Claude Code session to go through the authentication flow.

### Codex

The setup steps for the MCP server are the same regardless of whether you use the IDE Extension or the CLI since the configuration is shared.

**Configuration via CLI:**

Run the following command in Terminal:

```sh
codex mcp add linear --url https://mcp.linear.app/mcp
```

This will automatically prompt you to log in with your Linear account and connect it to your Codex.

**Note**: If this is the first time you are using an MCP in Codex you will need to enable the `rmcp` feature for this to work. Add the following into your `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```sh
[features]
experimental_use_rmcp_client = true
```

**Configuration through environment variables:**

1. Open the `~/.codex/config.toml` file in your preferred editor
2. Add the following:

```sh
[features]
experimental_use_rmcp_client = true

[mcp_servers.linear]
url = "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp"
```

Run `codex mcp login linear` to move through the authentication flow.

### Cursor

To add the MCP to Cursor, you can install by clicking [here](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=Linear&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5saW5lYXIuYXBwL21jcCJ9), or searching for Linear from Cursor's [MCP tools page](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp/directory).

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Why am I seeing an internal server error when trying to connect?</summary>
Enter the following in the Terminal to clear saved auth info: `rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth` then try again to connect.

Additionally you may need to update to a newer version of node if required.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I authenticate with multiple Linear workspaces?</summary>
The Linear MCP server authenticates each session via OAuth. Because reconnecting alone does not switch the workspace within an existing auth session, each workspace needs its own separate authentication context.

If your client or the `mcp-remote` module supports a configuration directory (for example via `MCP_REMOTE_CONFIG_DIR`), point each workspace to a different path:

```sh
MCP_REMOTE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.mcp-auth/workspace-a npx mcp-remote https://mcp.linear.app/mcp
MCP_REMOTE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.mcp-auth/workspace-b npx mcp-remote https://mcp.linear.app/mcp
```

Authenticate each configuration separately. For clients that manage their own auth storage, check the client's documentation for workspace-switching options.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I authenticate with my own API keys or OAuth access tokens?</summary>
The MCP server now supports passing OAuth token and API keys directly in the `Authorization: Bearer <yourtoken>` header instead of using the interactive authentication flow.

You can use this to interact with the MCP server as an `app` user, provide read-only access through a restricted API key, or integrate with an existing Linear OAuth application without an extra authentication hop.

For a read-only approach with your own API key, create a Linear API key with only the `Read` permission enabled.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What about the SSE endpoint?</summary>
The SSE endpoint at `https://mcp.linear.app/sse` is a deprecated fallback for clients that do not support Streamable HTTP.

For all new setups, use the primary Streamable HTTP endpoint at `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>My remote MCP connection dropped or isn't responding</summary>
Remote MCP connections can occasionally need a reconnect in some client setups. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the server from your client's MCP settings. This is a routine client-side reset and does not affect your Linear data or authentication session.
</details>

<details>
<summary>I'm using WSL on Windows, and seeing an error</summary>
The default connection uses Streamable HTTP at `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp`. If that does not work in WSL, use this SSE fallback instead (`/sse` is a legacy path for clients that do not support Streamable HTTP):

`{"mcpServers": {"linear": {"command": "wsl","args": ["npx","-y","mcp-remote","[https://mcp.linear.app/sse](https://mcp.linear.app/sse)","--transport sse-only"]}}}`
