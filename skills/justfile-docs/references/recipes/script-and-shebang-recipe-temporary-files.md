### Script and Shebang Recipe Temporary Files

Both script and shebang recipes write the recipe body to a temporary file for
execution. Script recipes execute that file by passing it to a command, while
shebang recipes execute the file directly. Shebang recipe execution will fail
if the filesystem containing the temporary file is mounted with `noexec` or is
otherwise non-executable.

The directory that `just` writes temporary files to may be configured in a
number of ways, from highest to lowest precedence:

- Globally with the `--tempdir` command-line option or the `JUST_TEMPDIR`
  environment variable<sup>1.41.0</sup>.

- On a per-module basis with the `tempdir` setting.

- Globally on Linux with the `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` environment variable.

- Falling back to the directory returned by
  [std::env::temp_dir](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/fn.temp_dir.html).
