### Dependencies

Dependencies run before recipes that depend on them:

```just
a: b
  @echo A

b:
  @echo B
```

```
$ just a
B
A
```

In a given invocation of `just`, a recipe with the same arguments will only run
once, regardless of how many times it appears in the command-line invocation,
or how many times it appears as a dependency:

```just
a:
  @echo A

b: a
  @echo B

c: a
  @echo C
```

```
$ just a a a a a
A
$ just b c
A
B
C
```

Multiple recipes may depend on a recipe that performs some kind of setup, and
when those recipes run, that setup will only be performed once:

```just
build:
  cc main.c

test-foo: build
  ./a.out --test foo

test-bar: build
  ./a.out --test bar
```

```
$ just test-foo test-bar
cc main.c
./a.out --test foo
./a.out --test bar
```

Recipes in a given run are only skipped when they receive the same arguments:

```just
build:
  cc main.c

test TEST: build
  ./a.out --test {{TEST}}
```

```
$ just test foo test bar
cc main.c
./a.out --test foo
./a.out --test bar
```

#### Running Recipes at the End of a Recipe

Normal dependencies of a recipes always run before a recipe starts. That is to
say, the dependee always runs before the depender. These dependencies are
called "prior dependencies".

A recipe can also have subsequent dependencies, which run immediately after the
recipe and are introduced with an `&&`:

```just
a:
  echo 'A!'

b: a && c d
  echo 'B!'

c:
  echo 'C!'

d:
  echo 'D!'
```

…running _b_ prints:

```console
$ just b
echo 'A!'
A!
echo 'B!'
B!
echo 'C!'
C!
echo 'D!'
D!
```

#### Running Recipes in the Middle of a Recipe

`just` doesn't support running recipes in the middle of another recipe, but you
can call `just` recursively in the middle of a recipe. Given the following
`justfile`:

```just
a:
  echo 'A!'

b: a
  echo 'B start!'
  just c
  echo 'B end!'

c:
  echo 'C!'
```

…running _b_ prints:

```console
$ just b
echo 'A!'
A!
echo 'B start!'
B start!
echo 'C!'
C!
echo 'B end!'
B end!
```

This has limitations, since recipe `c` is run with an entirely new invocation
of `just`: Assignments will be recalculated, dependencies might run twice, and
command line arguments will not be propagated to the child `just` process.
