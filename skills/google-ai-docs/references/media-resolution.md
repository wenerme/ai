# Media resolution

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** This version of the page covers the **Interactions API** . You can use the toggle on this page to switch to the [generateContent API version of this page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/generate-content/media-resolution).

The `media_resolution` parameter controls how the Gemini API processes media inputs like images, videos, and PDF documents by determining the **maximum number of tokens** allocated for media inputs, allowing you to balance response quality against latency and cost. For different settings, default values and how they correspond to tokens, see the [Token counts](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/media-resolution#token-counts) section.

You can configure media resolution for individual media objects (content items) within your request (Gemini 3 only).

## Per-content-item media resolution (Gemini 3 only)

Gemini 3 allows you to set media resolution for individual media objects within your request, offering fine-grained optimisation of token usage. You can mix resolution levels in a single request. For example, using high resolution for a complex diagram and low resolution for a simple contextual image.

### Python

    from google import genai

    client = genai.Client()

    myfile = client.files.upload(file="path/to/image.jpg")

    interaction = client.interactions.create(
        model="gemini-3.5-flash",
        input=[
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image:"},
            {
                "type": "image",
                "uri": myfile.uri,
                "mime_type": myfile.mime_type,
                "resolution": "high"
            }
        ]
    )
    print(interaction.output_text)

### JavaScript

    import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

    const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

    async function main() {
      const myfile = await ai.files.upload({
        file: "path/to/image.jpg",
        config: { mime_type: "image/jpeg" },
      });

      const interaction = await ai.interactions.create({
        model: "gemini-3.5-flash",
        input: [
          { type: "text", text: "Describe this image:" },
          {
            type: "image",
            uri: myfile.uri,
            mime_type: myfile.mimeType,
            resolution: "high"
          }
        ],
      });
      console.log(interaction.output_text);
    }

    await main();

### REST

    # First upload the file using the Files API, then use the URI:
    curl -X POST "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/interactions" \
      -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{
        "model": "gemini-3.5-flash",
        "input": [
          {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image:"},
          {
            "type": "image",
            "uri": "YOUR_FILE_URI",
            "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
            "resolution": "high"
          }
        ]
      }'

## Available resolution values

The Gemini API defines the following levels for media resolution:

- `unspecified`: The default setting. The token count for this level varies significantly between Gemini 3 and earlier Gemini models.
- `low`: Lower token count, resulting in faster processing and lower cost, but with less detail.
- `medium`: A balance between detail, cost, and latency.
- `high`: Higher token count, providing more detail for the model to work with, at the expense of increased latency and cost.
- `ultra_high` (Per content item only): Highest token count, required for specific use cases such as [computer use](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/computer-use).

Note that `high` provides the optimal performance for most use cases.

The exact number of tokens generated for each of these levels depends on both the **media type** (Image, Video, PDF) and the **model version**.

## Token counts

The tables below summarize the approximate token counts for each `media_resolution` value and media type per model family.

**Gemini 3 models**

| MediaResolution | Image | Video | PDF |
|---|---|---|---|
| `unspecified` (Default) | 1120 | 70 | 560 |
| `low` | 280 | 70 | 280 + Native Text |
| `medium` | 560 | 70 | 560 + Native Text |
| `high` | 1120 | 280 | 1120 + Native Text |
| `ultra_high` | 2240 | N/A | N/A |

## Choosing the right resolution

- **Default (`unspecified`):** Start with the default. It's tuned for a good balance of quality, latency, and cost for most common use cases.
- **`low`:** Use for scenarios where cost and latency are paramount, and fine-grained detail is less critical.
- **`medium` / `high`:** Increase the resolution when the task requires understanding intricate details within the media. This is often needed for complex visual analysis, chart reading, or dense document comprehension.
- **`ultra_high`** - Only available for per content item setting. Recommended for specific use cases such as computer use or where testing shows a clear enhancement over `high`.
- **Per-content-item control (Gemini 3):** Optimizes token usage. For example, in a prompt with multiple images, use `high` for a complex diagram and `low` or `medium` for simpler contextual images.

**Recommended settings**

The following lists the recommended media resolution settings for each supported media type.

| Media Type | Recommended Setting | Max Tokens | Usage Guidance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Images** | `high` | 1120 | Recommended for most image analysis tasks to ensure maximum quality. |
| **PDFs** | `medium` | 560 | Optimal for document understanding; quality typically saturates at `medium`. Increasing to `high` rarely improves OCR results for standard documents. |
| **Video** (General) | `low` (or `medium`) | 70 (per frame) | **Note:** For video, `low` and `medium` settings are treated identically (70 tokens) to optimize context usage. This is sufficient for most action recognition and description tasks. |
| **Video** (Text-heavy) | `high` | 280 (per frame) | Required only when the use case involves reading dense text (OCR) or small details within video frames. |

Always test and evaluate the impact of different resolution settings on your application to find the best trade-off between quality, latency, and cost.

## Version compatibility summary

- Setting the `resolution` on individual content items is **exclusive to Gemini 3 models**.
