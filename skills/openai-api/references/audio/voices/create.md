## Create voice

**post** `/audio/voices`

Creates a voice from a text prompt or from a consent recording and an audio sample.

For prompt-based creation, send `type: "prompt"` with a `name` and `prompt` as JSON or multipart form data. For creation from an audio sample, send `type: "audio_sample"` with a `name`, `audio_sample`, and `consent` recording ID as multipart form data. The type defaults to `audio_sample` when omitted.

Returns the saved voice's metadata. Voices created from text prompts are supported only in Live, not in Realtime or the speech endpoint. The response does not include preview audio.

### Body Parameters

- `name: string`

  The name of the new voice.

- `prompt: string`

  A description of the desired voice. Must not contain only whitespace.

- `type: "prompt"`

  Set to `prompt` to create a voice from a text description.

  - `"prompt"`

- `model: optional string or "auto" or "2026-10-01"`

- `script_hint: optional string`

  Optional text for the voice to speak during creation. If omitted, a script is generated from the prompt. Must not be blank after trimming whitespace; scripts that are too short are rejected.

### Returns
