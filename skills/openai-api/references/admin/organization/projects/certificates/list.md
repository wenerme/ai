**get** `/organization/projects/{project_id}/certificates`

List certificates for this project.

### Path Parameters

- `project_id: string`

### Query Parameters

- `after: optional string`

  A cursor for use in pagination. `after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include after=obj_foo in order to fetch the next page of the list.

- `limit: optional number`

  A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 20.

- `order: optional "asc" or "desc"`

  Sort order by the `created_at` timestamp of the objects. `asc` for ascending order and `desc` for descending order.

### Returns

  - `id: string`

    The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints

  - `active: boolean`

    Whether the certificate is currently active at the project level.

  - `certificate_details: object { expires_at, valid_at }`

    - `expires_at: optional number`

      The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the certificate expires.

    - `valid_at: optional number`

      The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the certificate becomes valid.

  - `created_at: number`

    The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the certificate was uploaded.

  - `name: string`
