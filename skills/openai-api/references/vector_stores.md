# File Batches

## Create

**post** `/vector_stores/{vector_store_id}/file_batches`

Create a vector store file batch.

### Path Parameters

- `vector_store_id: string`

### Body Parameters

- `attributes: optional map[string or number or boolean]`

  Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be
  useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured
  format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard. Keys are strings
  with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum
  length of 512 characters, booleans, or numbers.

  - `UnionMember0 = string`

  - `UnionMember1 = number`

  - `UnionMember2 = boolean`

- `chunking_strategy: optional FileChunkingStrategyParam`

  The chunking strategy used to chunk the file(s). If not set, will use the `auto` strategy.

  - `AutoFileChunkingStrategyParam = object { type }`

    The default strategy. This strategy currently uses a `max_chunk_size_tokens` of `800` and `chunk_overlap_tokens` of `400`.

    - `type: "auto"`

      Always `auto`.

      - `"auto"`

  - `StaticFileChunkingStrategyObjectParam = object { static, type }`

    Customize your own chunking strategy by setting chunk size and chunk overlap.

    - `static: StaticFileChunkingStrategy`

      - `chunk_overlap_tokens: number`

        The number of tokens that overlap between chunks. The default value is `400`.

        Note that the overlap must not exceed half of `max_chunk_size_tokens`.

      - `max_chunk_size_tokens: number`

        The maximum number of tokens in each chunk. The default value is `800`. The minimum value is `100` and the maximum value is `4096`.

    - `type: "static"`

      Always `static`.

      - `"static"`

- `file_ids: optional array of string`

  A list of [File](/docs/api-reference/files) IDs that the vector store should use. Useful for tools like `file_search` that can access files.  If `attributes` or `chunking_strategy` are provided, they will be  applied to all files in the batch. The maximum batch size is 2000 files. Mutually exclusive with `files`.

- `files: optional array of object { file_id, attributes, chunking_strategy }`

  A list of objects that each include a `file_id` plus optional `attributes` or `chunking_strategy`. Use this when you need to override metadata for specific files. The global `attributes` or `chunking_strategy` will be ignored and must be specified for each file. The maximum batch size is 2000 files. Mutually exclusive with `file_ids`.

  - `file_id: string`

    A [File](/docs/api-reference/files) ID that the vector store should use. Useful for tools like `file_search` that can access files.

  - `attributes: optional map[string or number or boolean]`
