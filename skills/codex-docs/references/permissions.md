# Permissions

Beta. Permission profiles are under active development and may change.

Permission profiles do not compose with the older sandbox settings. Configure
  either `default_permissions` and `[permissions]`, or `sandbox_mode` /
  `sandbox_workspace_write`, but not both. If `sandbox_mode` appears in any
  active config layer, you pass `--sandbox`, or a config profile sets
  `sandbox_mode`, Codex uses those older sandbox settings instead of
  `default_permissions`.

Permission profiles let you apply least-privilege boundaries to local commands
Codex runs on your behalf. A profile is a named policy that combines filesystem
rules, which define what commands can read or write, with network rules, which
define which destinations commands can reach.

Use profiles to give Codex enough access for the current task without granting
broad access to your machine or network. For example, a read-only profile can
let Codex inspect a project without editing it, while a write-capable profile
can limit edits to selected workspace roots.

Local permission profiles are supported on macOS, Linux, WSL, and native
Windows. Platform-specific enforcement details and caveats are covered in
[Security limitations](#security-limitations).

For Codex cloud network settings, see [Internet Access](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cloud/internet-access).

## Define and select a profile

Codex includes three built-in permission profiles:

- `:read-only` keeps local command execution read-only.
- `:workspace` allows writes inside the active workspace roots.
- `:danger-full-access` removes local sandbox restrictions and should be used
  only when that broad access is intentional.

Create a named profile under `[permissions.<name>]`, then set the top-level
`default_permissions` key to that profile name or to one of the built-ins above.
In this example, `project-edit` is a user-defined profile name, not a built-in
value.

Custom profiles use two related concepts:

- `[permissions.<name>.workspace_roots]` adds concrete directories that should
  count as workspace roots for that profile.
- `[permissions.<name>.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]` defines the filesystem
  rules Codex applies inside every effective workspace root: the current
  session's runtime workspace roots plus the profile-defined roots above.

Profiles also use the normal config-layer model. Higher-precedence layers can
add or replace entries under the same profile name without restating the whole
profile.

For example, an organization-level config and a user-level config can extend
the same profile independently:

```toml
# /etc/codex/config.toml
[permissions.server.workspace_roots]
"~/code/server" = true
```

```toml
# ~/.codex/config.toml
[permissions.server.workspace_roots]
"~/code/mobile-app" = true
```

When `server` is active, both workspace roots participate in the effective
profile.

```toml
default_permissions = "project-edit"

[permissions.project-edit.workspace_roots]
"~/code/app" = true
"~/code/shared-lib" = true

[permissions.project-edit.filesystem]
":minimal" = "read"

[permissions.project-edit.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"." = "write"
".devcontainer" = "read"
"**/*.env" = "deny"

[permissions.project-edit.network]
enabled = true

[permissions.project-edit.network.domains]
"api.openai.com" = "allow"
"objects.githubusercontent.com" = "allow"
"*.github.com" = "allow"
"tracking.example.com" = "deny"
```

This profile:

- Reads the minimal runtime paths common developer tools need.
- Applies the same workspace-root rules to the current session and the
  profile-defined roots.
- Keeps IDE-adjacent settings such as `.devcontainer/` read-only under each
  root.
- Denies matching environment files with a glob rule.
- Allows network access only through the configured domain policy.

Inside an active profile, narrower deny rules stay in force even when a broader
path is readable or writable. For example, a profile can make workspace roots
writable while still setting a matching `.env` path to `deny`.

## Configuration spec

| Entry                                                             | Type / values              | Default                 | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default_permissions`                                             | String profile name        | None                    | Names the permissions profile Codex applies by default. The value must match a profile under `[permissions]` or a built-in profile such as `:workspace`. Required when permission profiles are active. If an older sandbox setting is active, Codex uses those older sandbox settings instead. |
| `[permissions.<name>]`                                            | Table                      | None                    | Defines a profile and its identifier. `default_permissions` selects one profile as the default; other permission-profile selectors also use the profile name.                                                                                                                                  |
| `[permissions.<name>.workspace_roots]`                            | Table                      | None                    | Adds profile-defined workspace roots that receive `:workspace_roots` filesystem rules alongside the current session's runtime workspace roots.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `permissions.<name>.workspace_roots."<path>"`                     | Boolean                    | `false`                 | Adds the path to the profile's workspace root set when `true`. Entries set to `false` remain inactive.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `[permissions.<name>.filesystem]`                                 | Table                      | None                    | Maps filesystem paths to access values or scoped subpath maps. Missing or empty filesystem tables keep filesystem access restricted and emit a startup warning.                                                                                                                                |
| `permissions.<name>.filesystem.glob_scan_max_depth`               | Number                     | None                    | Limits deny-read glob expansion on Linux, WSL, and native Windows when Codex snapshots matches before sandbox startup. Larger values can increase startup scanning work. Use a value of at least `1` when an unbounded `**` pattern needs bounded pre-expansion.                               |
| `[permissions.<name>.filesystem]."<path>"`                        | `read`, `write`, or `deny` | None                    | Grants direct access for a supported path. `deny` denies access and wins over equally specific `write` or `read` entries. Codex rejects direct write rules that the active runtime cannot enforce.                                                                                             |
| `[permissions.<name>.filesystem."<path>"]."<subpath>"`            | `read`, `write`, or `deny` | None                    | Grants access to a descendant of `<path>`. Use `.` for the base path. Other subpaths must be relative descendants and cannot contain `.` or `..` components.                                                                                                                                   |
| `[permissions.<name>.network]`                                    | Table                      | None                    | Configures the network sandbox proxy and the sandbox network policy for the profile.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `permissions.<name>.network.enabled`                              | Boolean                    | `false`                 | Enables network access for sandboxed commands in the profile. This changes the sandbox network policy; it does not start the network proxy by itself.                                                                                                                                          |

If there are no `allow` entries, domain requests are blocked. Deny entries override allow entries.                                                                                                                                                    |

Host patterns are normalized by trimming, lowercasing, stripping a trailing dot, and stripping simple ports or brackets.                            |
| `[permissions.<name>.network.unix_sockets]`                       | Table                      | None                    | Maps Unix socket allowlist overrides.

## Filesystem permissions

Filesystem entries use `read`, `write`, or `deny`:

| Access  | Meaning                                                                                                                           |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `read`  | Allows commands to read files and list directories under the path. Commands cannot create, modify, rename, or delete files there. |
| `write` | Allows commands to read and modify files under the path, including creating, renaming, and deleting files when the OS allows it.  |
| `deny`  | Denies both reads and writes under the path. Use it to carve out a denied subpath from a broader `read` or `write` grant.         |

More specific entries override broader entries. When two entries target the
same path, `deny` takes precedence over `write`, and `write` takes precedence
over `read`.

This precedence lets a profile describe a broad working area first, then carve
out files or directories that should stay unreadable:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.filesystem]
":minimal" = "read"

[permissions.project-edit.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"." = "write"
".devcontainer" = "read"
"**/*.env" = "deny"
```

In this example, the workspace root stays writable, `.devcontainer/` stays
readable without becoming writable, and matching environment files remain
unavailable to sandboxed commands.

A more specific path can also reopen a narrower subtree inside a broader deny:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.filesystem]
"~/Documents" = "deny"
"~/Documents/codex" = "write"
```

Supported path forms:

| Path               | Meaning                                                                                     | Scoped subpaths |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `:root`            | The filesystem root                                                                         | `.` only        |
| `:minimal`         | Platform and runtime paths needed by common tools                                           | `.` only        |
| `:workspace_roots` | The current session's workspace roots plus any enabled profile-defined workspace roots      | Yes             |
| `:tmpdir`          | The `$TMPDIR` location, when one is available                                               | `.` only        |
| `/absolute/path`   | A platform absolute path, such as `/path` on macOS/Linux/WSL or `C:\path` on native Windows | Yes             |
| `~/path`           | A path under the current user's home directory                                              | Yes             |

On native Windows, home-relative paths can also use backslashes, such as
`~\work`.

Use `:root` only when a profile intentionally needs broad read coverage:

```toml
[permissions.audit.filesystem]
":root" = "read"
```

Use nested entries under `:workspace_roots` to scope access to workspace-root
relative subpaths:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"." = "write"          # each workspace root
"docs" = "read"        # each workspace-root docs directory
"generated" = "deny"   # each workspace-root generated directory
```

Nested subpaths must stay inside their workspace root. Parent traversal such as
`../other-repo` is rejected.

### Deny reads with exact paths or globs

Use `deny` for files or subtrees that Codex should not read, even when a broader
profile rule grants access nearby. Exact paths work well for stable locations
such as `~/.ssh`. Glob patterns work better when a profile needs to cover a
family of sensitive files whose exact locations vary across repositories.

When a glob sits under `:workspace_roots`, Codex interprets it relative to each
effective workspace root. For example:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"**/*.env" = "deny"
```

This rule denies reads for matching `.env` files found beneath each runtime or
profile-defined workspace root. Use it when you want to preserve normal
workspace writes while keeping environment files, generated secrets, or similar
credential-bearing files unreadable.

`deny` glob patterns are supported as deny-read rules. `read` or `write` globs
are less portable on Linux, WSL, and native Windows sandboxing, so prefer exact
paths or subtree rules such as `"docs/**" = "read"` when possible.

On Linux, WSL, and native Windows, an unbounded `**` deny-read pattern may need
bounded pre-expansion before the sandbox starts. Set `glob_scan_max_depth` when
you use an unbounded pattern such as `"**/*.env" = "deny"`:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.filesystem]
glob_scan_max_depth = 3

[permissions.project-edit.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"**/*.env" = "deny"
```

`glob_scan_max_depth` must be at least `1`. Higher values scan deeper before
sandbox startup, which can add startup work on Linux, WSL, and native Windows.
If you prefer not to use bounded expansion, enumerate explicit depths such as
`*.env`, `*/*.env`, and `*/*/*.env`.

Add reusable workspace roots to the profile when the same rules should apply to
more than the current session root:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.workspace_roots]
"~/code/app" = true
"~/code/shared-lib" = true
```

When this profile is active, Codex applies the `:workspace_roots` rules to the
current session's runtime workspace roots and to each enabled profile-defined
workspace root.

On native Windows, drive-letter paths such as `D:\work` and UNC paths such as
`\\server\share` are supported as absolute paths.

## Network permissions

Set `enabled = true` to allow network access for the selected profile:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.network]
enabled = true
```

When network access is enabled, Codex uses full network behavior by default.
Most profiles should also define domain rules:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.network.domains]
"example.com" = "allow"      # exact host
"*.example.com" = "allow"    # subdomains only
"**.example.com" = "allow"   # apex and subdomains
"ads.example.com" = "deny"   # deny wins over allow
```

The network sandbox proxy binds to local listeners by default:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.network]
enabled = true
proxy_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3128"
enable_socks5 = true
socks_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8081"
enable_socks5_udp = true
```

Leave these listener settings at their defaults unless you are integrating with
a specific runtime. The `dangerously_*` network keys are escape hatches for
specialized environments and should not be used for ordinary local development.

### Local and private networks

Codex applies a local/private-network guard by default as a defense against DNS
rebinding and accidental access to local services. To intentionally allow a
literal local target, allowlist the exact host or IP literal:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.network.domains]
"localhost" = "allow"
"127.0.0.1" = "allow"
```

Set `allow_local_binding = true` only when the profile must reach allowlisted
hostnames that resolve to local or private addresses:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.network]
enabled = true
allow_local_binding = true

[permissions.project-edit.network.domains]
"localhost" = "allow"
```

### Unix sockets

Unix socket proxying is a local escape hatch for tools such as Docker. Use it
sparingly:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.network.unix_sockets]
"/var/run/docker.sock" = "allow"
"/tmp/old.sock" = "none"
```

Use `none` to clear a socket allow entry inherited from a lower-precedence
configuration layer. It is not a domain-style deny rule.

When Unix sockets are enabled, keep proxy listeners bound to loopback addresses.

## Migrate from older sandbox settings

Permission profiles replace the older combination of `sandbox_mode` and
`sandbox_workspace_write` when you want one reusable profile to describe both
filesystem and network behavior. Use one system or the other for a session, not
both.

Suggested starting points:

- For a read-only workflow, use the built-in `:read-only` profile or define a
  custom profile with read access only where needed.
- For workspace editing, use the built-in `:workspace` profile or define a
  custom profile that writes through `:workspace_roots` and adds only the extra
  temp or cache paths the workflow needs.
- For unrestricted local execution, use `:danger-full-access` only when you
  intentionally want the broadest local access model.

Profiles describe the local default posture for a session. Organization-managed
requirements can still add restrictions that user configuration should not
broaden. See [Managed configuration](https://developers.openai.com/codex/enterprise/managed-configuration)
for admin-enforced filesystem and network constraints.

## Scope and enforcement

Permission profiles define the boundaries for local sandboxed command
execution. Use them together with approval policies and the separate controls
for other Codex surfaces.

### What profiles control

- **Local command execution:** Permission profiles govern sandboxed commands
  that run on your machine. App connectors, MCP servers, browser or
  computer-use surfaces, Codex cloud environment settings, and approved
  escalations use their own controls.
- **Filesystem writes:** A write-capable profile can create persistent changes.
  Treat writes to scripts, build steps, package manager hooks, shell startup
  files, and shared directories as sensitive because later tools or users can
  execute those files outside the original sandbox context.
- **Outbound destinations:** Network domain rules constrain where sandboxed
  command traffic can go through the network proxy. They do not determine
  whether an allowed destination is trustworthy, and wildcard allow rules stay
  broad.
- **Local services:** Local and private network targets are blocked by default.
  Allowlisting `localhost`, private IPs, Unix sockets, or setting
  `allow_local_binding = true` explicitly opens access to local services.

### How enforcement works

- On macOS, Codex uses Seatbelt sandbox profiles. If the selected policy cannot
  be enforced by the platform sandbox, Codex refuses to run the command instead
  of silently running it unsandboxed.
- On Linux and WSL, Codex uses [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap)
  and [seccomp](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/seccomp_filter.html),
  with Landlock available for compatibility fallback paths. The strongest
  enforcement path depends on user namespaces and kernel support; restricted
  container hosts can force compatibility paths, and unsupported split policies
  are refused.
- On native Windows, [`elevated` sandboxing](https://developers.openai.com/codex/windows#windows-sandbox)
  is strongest because it can use dedicated lower-privilege sandbox users,
  filesystem permission boundaries, and firewall rules. `unelevated`
  sandboxing is a fallback with weaker network isolation and cannot enforce
  every split read/write carveout, so unsupported policies are refused. Use WSL
  when you need the Linux sandbox model.

### Operational guidance

Choose the narrowest profile that still lets the task complete, especially when
you grant writes or outbound network access. Keep approval policy, secret
handling, and allow rules aligned with that access level.

## Common profiles

### Read-only with network allowlist

```toml
default_permissions = "readonly-net"

[permissions.readonly-net.filesystem]
":minimal" = "read"

[permissions.readonly-net.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"." = "read"

[permissions.readonly-net.network]
enabled = true

[permissions.readonly-net.network.domains]
"api.openai.com" = "allow"
```

### Workspace write without network

```toml
default_permissions = "project-edit"

[permissions.project-edit.filesystem]
":minimal" = "read"

[permissions.project-edit.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"." = "write"

[permissions.project-edit.network]
enabled = false
```

### Workspace write with public web access

```toml
default_permissions = "workspace-net"

[permissions.workspace-net.filesystem]
":minimal" = "read"

[permissions.workspace-net.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"." = "write"

[permissions.workspace-net.network]
enabled = true

[permissions.workspace-net.network.domains]
"*" = "allow"
```

Use the global `"*"` allow rule only when you intend to allow public network
access. Deny rules can narrow a broad allowlist.
