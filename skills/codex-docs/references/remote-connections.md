Remote connections let you use Codex when you are away from the machine that
runs it, or when your project lives on another machine. Connect the ChatGPT
mobile app to a Codex App host, pick up work from another device, or configure
Codex to work on an SSH host.

Remote access uses the connected host's projects, threads, files, credentials,
permissions, plugins, Computer Use, browser setup, and local tools.

## What you can do remotely

- Start new threads in projects on the host, or continue existing ones.
- Send follow-up instructions, answer questions, and steer active work.
- Approve commands and other actions.
- Review outputs, diffs, test results, terminal output, and screenshots.
- Get notified when Codex completes a task or needs your attention.
- Switch between connected hosts and threads.

The next sections cover using the ChatGPT mobile app to control a Codex App
host. To connect Codex to a project on an SSH host, see
[connect to an SSH host](#connect-to-an-ssh-host).

## Before you set up mobile access

Make sure you have:

- Codex access in the ChatGPT account and workspace you want to use.
- The latest ChatGPT mobile app on an iOS or Android device. If you do not see
  Codex in the app, update ChatGPT first.
- A Mac host that is awake, online, running the Codex App, and signed in to the
  same account and workspace. Mobile setup and device control currently require
  the Codex App for macOS on the host; the setup flow isn't available from the
  Codex CLI or IDE Extension.
- Any required multi-factor authentication, SSO, or passkey configuration for
  that account or workspace.

If you use Codex through a ChatGPT workspace, your admin may need to enable
Remote Control access before you can connect from your phone.

## Set up mobile access

Start in the Codex App on the host you want to connect. The setup flow enables
remote access for that host, then shows a QR code you can scan from your phone.

<WorkflowSteps variant="headings">

1. Start Codex mobile setup.

   Open Codex on the host and select **Set up Codex mobile** in the
   sidebar.

2. Scan the QR code.

   Use your phone to scan the QR code shown by Codex. The code opens ChatGPT so
   you can finish connecting the mobile app to the host.

3. Finish setup in ChatGPT.

   ChatGPT opens the Codex mobile setup flow. Confirm the same ChatGPT account
   and workspace, then complete any required multi-factor authentication, SSO,
   or passkey steps. After setup succeeds, the host appears in Codex on your
   phone.

4. Review host settings.

   In Codex on the host, use **Settings > Connections** to manage connected
   devices. You can also choose whether to keep the computer awake, enable
   Computer Use, or install the Chrome extension.

</div>

## Choose what to connect

Start with the Mac laptop or desktop where you already use Codex. Add an
always-on Mac or SSH host when you need continuous access or a different
environment.

### <span class="not-prose inline-flex items-center gap-3 align-middle"><span class="inline-flex h-7 w-7 shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-md bg-surface-secondary text-secondary"><Desktop width={17} height={17} /></span><span>Your Mac laptop or desktop</span></span>

Connect the Mac where you already run Codex day to day. This gives remote access
to the same projects, threads, credentials, plugins, and local setup you already
use.

If that Mac sleeps, loses network access, or closes Codex, remote access stops
until it is available again. If you use this computer as your host device, keep
it plugged in and turn on **Keep this Mac awake** in the host's connection
settings.

### <span class="not-prose inline-flex items-center gap-3 align-middle"><span class="inline-flex h-7 w-7 shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-md bg-surface-secondary text-secondary"><Storage width={17} height={17} /></span><span>A dedicated always-on Mac</span></span>

Use a dedicated always-on Mac when you want Codex to stay reachable for
longer-running work.

Install the projects, credentials, plugins, MCP servers, and tools Codex should
use on that machine.

Use an SSH host or managed devbox when the project already lives in a remote
environment. Connect the Codex App host to that environment first; your phone
still connects to the Codex App host, and Codex works in the remote environment
with its dependencies, security policies, and compute resources.

For SSH setup details, see [connect to an SSH host](#connect-to-an-ssh-host).

## What comes from the connected host

Your phone sends prompts, approvals, and follow-up messages to Codex. The
connected host provides the environment Codex uses.

That means:

- Repository files and local documents come from the connected host.
- Shell commands run on that host or remote environment.
- Any plugin installed on that host is available when you use Codex remotely.
- MCP servers, skills, browser access, and Computer Use come from that host's
  configuration.
- Signed-in websites and desktop apps are available only when the host can
  access them.
- Sandboxing, security controls, and action approvals still apply to the
  connected session.

Codex uses a secure relay layer to keep trusted machines reachable across your
authorized ChatGPT devices without exposing them directly to the public
internet.

## Pick up work from another device

You can also connect one Codex App host to another. For example, if your laptop
is unavailable, you can start a thread from your phone on an always-on host,
then later open Codex on your laptop and continue that thread from there.

In Codex on the laptop, use **Settings > Connections > Control other devices**
to add the other host. A device can allow remote access and control another
device at the same time.

</div>

## Connect to an SSH host

In the Codex App, add remote projects from an SSH host and run threads against
the remote filesystem and shell. Remote project threads run commands, read
files, and write changes on the remote host.

Keep the remote host configured with the same security expectations you use for
normal SSH access: trusted keys, least-privilege accounts, and no
unauthenticated public listeners.

<WorkflowSteps variant="headings">

1. Add the host to your SSH config so Codex can auto-discover it.

   ```text
   Host devbox
     HostName devbox.example.com
     User you
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

   Codex reads concrete host aliases from `~/.ssh/config`, resolves them with
   OpenSSH, and ignores pattern-only hosts.

2. Confirm you can SSH to the host from the machine running the Codex App.

   ```bash
   ssh devbox
   ```

3. Install and authenticate Codex on the remote host.

   The app starts the remote Codex app server through SSH, using the remote
   user's login shell. Make sure the `codex` command is available on the
   remote host's `PATH` in that shell.

4. In the Codex App, open **Settings > Connections**, add or enable the SSH
   host, then choose a remote project folder.

</WorkflowSteps>

  class="p-3 sm:p-4"
  imageClass="rounded-xl"
/>

## Authentication and network exposure

Use SSH port forwarding with local-host WebSocket listeners. Don't expose an
unauthenticated app-server listener on a shared or public network.

If you need to reach a remote machine outside your current network, use a VPN or
mesh networking tool such as Tailscale instead of exposing the app server
directly to the internet.

## Troubleshooting

### You do not see the host on your phone

Confirm that the Codex App is running on the host, **Allow other devices to
connect** is enabled, and the same ChatGPT account and workspace are selected on
both devices.

### The approval request does not appear

Open the ChatGPT mobile app and go to Codex. Confirm that the phone and host use
the same ChatGPT account and workspace, then scan the QR code again or restart
setup from the host. If you use a ChatGPT workspace, ask your admin to confirm
that Remote Control access is enabled.

### The remote session disconnects

Check whether the host went to sleep, lost network access, or closed Codex.
Keep the host awake and connected while Codex works.

### Authentication blocks setup

Complete the account or workspace authentication prompt shown during setup. If
your organization requires SSO, multi-factor authentication, or a passkey,
finish that flow before trying again. If setup still fails, ask your workspace
admin to confirm that Remote Control access is enabled.
