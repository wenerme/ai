# Record & Replay

Record & Replay is available on macOS. Initial availability excludes the
  European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. Computer Use must
  also be available and enabled.

Record & Replay lets you demonstrate a workflow on your
Mac and turn it into a reusable skill. Use it when the workflow is repetitive,
depends on your preferences, or is easier to show than to describe in a prompt.

For example, you might record how you file an expense, book a parking space,
create a correctly configured issue, publish a video, or download a recurring
report. Codex can package the pattern into a skill that you can use again with
Computer Use, browser actions, connected plugins, or a combination of them.

## Before you start

Pick a workflow that you already know how to complete. Record & Replay works
best when the steps are stable and the success criteria are clear.

## Start a recording

<WorkflowSteps>

1. Open **Plugins** in the Codex app.
2. Open the **+** menu.
3. Select **Record a skill**.
4. Review the suggested prompt, give Codex any helpful context, and submit it.
5. When Codex asks for permission to record your actions, approve the request
   once you are ready to demonstrate the workflow.
6. Perform the workflow on your Mac.
7. When you are done, stop recording from the menu bar, overlay, or tell Codex
   that you are done.

</WorkflowSteps>

During recording, Codex observes the actions and window content needed to learn
the workflow. Recording continues until you stop it. Keep the recording focused
on the task you want Codex to learn.

After you stop recording, Codex inspects the captured workflow and drafts a
skill. The skill explains when to use the workflow, what inputs it needs, what
steps to follow, and how to verify the result. You can also ask Codex to
refine the skill further.

## Replay the workflow

Start a new thread and ask Codex to use the generated skill. Give it the
values that are different this time, such as the file to upload, the issue to
create, or the date range for the report.

Codex uses the skill as reusable context for the task. It can then complete the
workflow with the tools available in the current environment, including
Computer Use, browser actions, and installed plugins.

## Tips for better recordings

- Keep the demonstration short and complete.
- Let Codex know your goal and any specific inputs that might vary between
  skill uses before you start recording.
- Use realistic inputs, but avoid secrets and sensitive data.
- Refine the skill after recording to call out hidden preferences that matter,
  such as naming conventions, field defaults, or decision points.
- Stop recording when the workflow is complete instead of continuing into
  unrelated cleanup.

## When to build another plugin

Record & Replay is a fast way to create a skill from a demonstrated workflow.
If you want to distribute a separate stable package across a team, bundle
multiple skills, include app integrations, add MCP servers, or manage install
metadata, package that workflow as its own plugin. See
[Build plugins](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build).

## Troubleshooting

### I don't see Record & Replay

If your organization manages Codex with `requirements.toml`, the
`[features].computer_use` requirement controls Record & Replay too. Setting
`computer_use = false` makes both features unavailable.
