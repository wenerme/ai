# Codex IDE extension slash commands

Slash commands let you control Codex without leaving the chat input. Use them to check status, switch between local and cloud mode, or send feedback.

## Use a slash command

1. In the Codex chat input, type `/`.
2. Select a command from the list, or keep typing to filter (for example, `/status`).
3. Press **Enter**.
