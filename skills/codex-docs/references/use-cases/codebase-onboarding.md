## Introduction

When you are new to a repo or dropped into an unfamiliar feature, Codex can help you get oriented before you start changing code. The goal is not just to get a high-level summary, but to map the request flow, understand which modules own what, and identify the next files worth reading.

## How to use

If you're new to a project, you can simply start by asking Codex to explain the whole codebase:

If you need to contribute a new feature to an existing codebase, you can ask codex to explain a specific system area. The better you scope the request, the more concrete the explanation will be:

1. Give Codex the relevant files, directories, or feature area you are trying to understand.
2. Ask it to trace the request flow and explain which modules own the business logic, transport, persistence, or UI.
3. Ask where validation, side effects, or state transitions happen before you edit anything.
4. End by asking which files you should read next and what the risky spots are.

A useful onboarding answer should leave you with a concrete map, not just a list of filenames. By the end, Codex should have explained the main flow, highlighted the risky parts, and pointed you to the next files or checks that matter before you start editing.

## Questions to ask next

Once Codex gives you a first pass, keep going until the explanation is specific enough that you would trust yourself to make the first edit. Good follow-up questions usually force it to call out assumptions, hidden dependencies, and the checks that matter after a change.

- Which module owns the actual business logic versus the transport or UI layer?
- Where does validation happen, and what assumptions are enforced there?
- What related files or background jobs are easy to miss if I change this flow?
- Which tests or checks should I run after editing this area?
