    fallback paths
  - Agentic debugging loops where Codex should patch code, rerun the app,

  title: Instrument One Feature and Verify It from Logs
  body: >-
    Use the Build macOS Apps plugin to add lightweight unified logging around
    [name one Mac feature or action flow], then run the app and verify from logs
    that those events fire in the expected order.


    Constraints:

    - Prefer `Logger` from `OSLog`, not `print`, and create a clear
    subsystem/category pair for this feature so the logs are easy to filter.

    - Log one concise line for each important action boundary or state
    transition: for example window opened, sidebar selection changed, menu
    command invoked, sync started, sync finished, or fallback path taken.

    - Keep permanent `info` logs stable and high signal. Use `debug` only for
    noisy local details, and remove or demote temporary instrumentation before
    finishing.

    - Do not log secrets, auth tokens, personal data, or raw document contents.
    If an identifier must be logged, choose the safest privacy annotation and
    explain why.

    - Build and run the app, exercise the feature path yourself, and verify the
    events with Console or a focused `log stream` predicate.

    - If the flow is long, intermittent, or easier to reproduce by hand, save
    the filtered log stream to a small local session trace file, let me manually
    exercise the app if needed, then read that file back and summarize the event
    timeline.

    - If an expected event does not appear, move the log closer to the suspected
    control path, rerun the flow, and continue until the logs explain what
    happened.


    Deliver:

    - the new logger setup and the exact events you added

    - the Console filter or `log stream` predicate you used

    - a short before/after summary of what the logs now make observable

    - the saved trace file and timeline summary if this became a longer capture
    session

    - one or two representative log lines that prove the flow is instrumented
    correctly

## Add one Logger where debugging gets vague

This use case is for Mac app flows where "something happened" is too fuzzy to debug from code review alone. Ask Codex to add a few high-signal unified logs around one behavior, run the app, trigger that behavior, and verify from Console or `log stream` that the expected events fired.

Use the [Build macOS Apps plugin](https://github.com/openai/plugins/tree/main/plugins/build-macos-apps) for that loop. Its macOS telemetry skill is intentionally lightweight: use Apple's `Logger`, choose a clear subsystem/category pair, log action boundaries and state transitions, avoid sensitive payloads, and verify the event after a local build/run instead of assuming the instrumentation is wired correctly.

## Why telemetry is useful for agentic engineering

Good logs give Codex a repeatable feedback loop after each patch. Instead of asking you to manually inspect every window, menu action, or sync transition, the agent can run the app, exercise the flow, inspect filtered logs, and decide the next code change from evidence.

That is especially useful for three agentic loops:

- **Hands-free debug loop:** Codex instruments a suspicious flow, launches the app, clicks the sidebar or triggers a command, reads the emitted log sequence, patches the state update path, and reruns the same flow until the logs and UI behavior agree.
- **App session collection loop:** Codex adds one event for app launch, window open, sidebar selection, import started, import finished, and import failed, then runs a local session and summarizes the resulting timeline so missing or out-of-order transitions become obvious.
- **Human-driven capture loop:** Codex launches the app with logging enabled, keeps a focused log stream running while you manually exercise a tricky flow, then inspects the captured session afterward and proposes the next patch from that trace.

## Keep the instrumentation small and filterable

Ask Codex for one logger per feature area, not one permanent log line for every state mutation. Feature categories such as `Windowing`, `Commands`, `MenuBar`, `Sidebar`, `Sync`, or `Import` make logs much easier to filter during the next debugging pass.

```swift
import OSLog

private let logger = Logger(
  subsystem: Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier ?? "SampleApp",
  category: "Sidebar"
)

@MainActor
func selectItem(_ item: SidebarItem) {
  logger.info("Selected sidebar item: \(item.id, privacy: .public)")
  selection = item.id
}
```

Use `info` for concise action and lifecycle events that should remain useful over time, and `debug` for noisier local state details that may be removed or demoted before the task is done. Add signposts only when you are measuring a timing span, not by default.

## Ask Codex to prove the event from logs

The useful part is not just adding `Logger` calls. Ask Codex to run the app, trigger the instrumented flow, and give you the exact Console filter or `log stream` predicate it used plus one or two representative log lines.

```bash
log stream --style compact --predicate 'subsystem == "com.example.app" && category == "Sidebar"'
```

If an expected event does not appear, ask Codex to move the log closer to the suspected control path, rerun the same flow, and keep iterating until the logs explain what happened. If the task turns into a crash or backtrace analysis, pivot to the plugin's build/run debugging workflow and keep the telemetry focused on the action boundaries.

## Save a session trace for a later Codex pass

For longer or intermittent bugs, ask Codex to save a focused log stream to a small local trace file, summarize the timeline, and leave that artifact in the workspace so a later Codex run can inspect the same evidence without replaying the whole session from memory. That makes multi-pass debugging easier when you want one agent run to collect a trace and another run to compare behavior before and after a patch.

This also works well when the human needs to drive part of the session. Ask Codex to launch the app in a logging-friendly debug loop, start a filtered capture, wait while you reproduce the issue manually, and then read the saved trace file once you are done.

## Practical tips

### Instrument one feature at a time

Start with one sidebar, window, command, or sync path so the log sequence stays easy to inspect. If that path becomes reliable, Codex can expand the same pattern to neighboring flows.

### Make privacy part of the prompt

Ask Codex to explain every logged identifier and to avoid writing secrets, personal data, or raw content to unified logs. A tiny event vocabulary is usually enough for local debugging.

### Keep sample output in the final summary

Representative log lines make the change much easier to trust than "telemetry was added." Ask Codex to include the filter predicate and a short action timeline so the next agent run can reuse the same verification loop.
