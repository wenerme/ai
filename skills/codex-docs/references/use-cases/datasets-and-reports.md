## Introduction

At its core, data analysis is about using data to inform decisions. The goal isn't analysis for its own sake. It's to produce an artifact that helps someone act: a chart for leadership, an experiment readout for a product team, a model evaluation for researchers, or a dashboard that guides daily operations.

A useful framework, popularized by _R for Data Science_, is a loop: import and tidy data, then iterate between transform, visualize, and model to build understanding before you communicate results. Programming surrounds that whole cycle.

Codex fits well into this workflow. It helps you move around the loop faster by cleaning data, exploring hypotheses, generating analyses, and producing reproducible artifacts. The target isn't a one-off notebook. The target is a workflow that other people can review, trust, and rerun.

## Define your use case

Choose one concrete question you want to answer with your data.

The more specific the question, the better. It will help Codex understand what you want to achieve and how to help you get there.

### Running example: Property values near the highway

As an example, we'll explore the following question:

> To what extent are houses near the highway lower in property valuation?

Suppose one dataset contains property values or sale prices, and another contains location, parcel, or highway-proximity information. The work isn't only to run a model. It's to make the inputs trustworthy, document the joins, pressure-test the result, and end with an artifact that somebody else can use.

## Set up the environment

When you start a new data analysis project, you need to set up the environment and define the rules of the project.

- **Environment:** Codex should know which Python environment, package manager, folders, and output conventions are canonical for the project.
- **Skills:** Repeated workflows such as notebook cleanup, spreadsheet exports, or final report packaging should move into reusable skills instead of being re-explained in every prompt.
- **Worktrees:** Separate explorations into separate worktrees so one hypothesis, merge strategy, or visualization branch doesn't bleed into another.

To learn more about how to install and use skills, see our [skills documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills).

### Guide Codex's behavior

Before touching the data, tell Codex how to behave in the repo. Put personal defaults in `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, and put project rules in the repository `AGENTS.md`.

A small `AGENTS.md` is often enough:

```md
## Data analysis defaults

- Use `uv run` or the project's existing Python environment.
- Keep source data in `data/raw/` and write cleaned data to `data/processed/`.
- Put exploratory notebooks in `analysis/` and final artifacts in `output/`.
- Never overwrite raw files.
- Prefer scripts or checked-in notebooks over unnamed scratch cells.
- Before merging datasets, report candidate keys, null rates, and join coverage.
```

If the repo doesn't already define a Python environment, ask Codex to create a reproducible setup and explain how to run it. For data analysis work, that step matters more than jumping straight into charts.

## Import the data

Often the fastest way to start is to paste the file path and ask Codex to inspect it. This is where Codex helps you answer basic but important questions:

- What file formats are here?
- What does each dataset seem to represent?
- Which columns might be targets, identifiers, dates, locations, or measures?
- Where are the clear quality issues?

Don't ask for conclusions yet. Ask for inventory and explanation first.

## Tidy and merge the inputs

Most real work starts here. You have two or more datasets, the primary key isn't clear, and a naive merge could lose data or create duplicates.

Ask Codex to profile the merge before performing it:

- Check uniqueness for candidate keys.
- Measure null rates and formatting differences.
- Normalize clear formatting issues such as casing, whitespace, or address formatting.
- Run trial joins and report match rates.
- Recommend the safest merge strategy before it writes the final merged file.

If you need to derive the best key, such as a normalized address, a parcel identifier built from a few columns, or a location join, make Codex explain the tradeoffs and edge cases before you accept the merge.

## Explore with charts and separate worktrees

Exploratory data analysis is where Codex benefits from clean isolation. One worktree can test address cleanup or feature engineering while another focuses on charts or alternate model directions. That keeps each diff reviewable and prevents one long thread from mixing incompatible ideas.

The Codex app includes built-in worktree support. If you are working in a terminal, plain Git worktrees work well too:

```bash
git worktree add ../analysis-highway-eda -b analysis/highway-eda
git worktree add ../analysis-model-comparison -b analysis/highway-modeling
```

In the running example, this step is where you would compare homes near the highway against homes farther away, examine outliers, inspect missing-value patterns, and decide whether the observed effect looks real or reflects neighborhood composition, home size, or other factors.

## Model the question

Not every analysis needs a complex model. Start with an interpretable baseline.

For the highway question, a sensible first pass is a regression or other transparent model that estimates the relationship between highway proximity and property value while controlling for relevant factors such as size, age, and location.

Ask Codex to be explicit about:

- The target variable and feature definitions.
- Which controls to include and why.
- Leakage risks and exclusions.
- How it chose the split, evaluation, or uncertainty estimate.
- What the result means in plain language.

If the first model is weak, that's still useful. It tells you whether the problem is the model, the features, the join quality, or the question itself.

## Communicate the result

The analysis is only useful when someone else can consume it. Ask Codex to produce the artifact the audience needs:

- A Markdown memo for technical collaborators.
- A spreadsheet or CSV for downstream operations work.
- A `.docx` brief using `$doc` when formatting and tables matter.
- A rendered appendix or final deliverable using `$pdf`.
- A lightweight dashboard or static report site deployed with `$vercel-deploy`.

This is also where you ask for caveats. If the join quality is imperfect, sampling bias is present, or the model assumptions are fragile, Codex should say that plainly in the deliverable.

## Skills to consider

The curated skills that fit this workflow especially well are:

- `$spreadsheet` for CSV, TSV, and Excel editing or exports.
- `$jupyter-notebook` when the deliverable should stay notebook-native.
- `$doc` and `$pdf` for stakeholder-facing outputs.
- `$vercel-deploy` when you want to share the result as a URL.

Once the workflow stabilizes, create repo-local skills for the repeated parts, such as `refresh-data`, `merge-and-qa`, or `publish-weekly-report`. That's a better long-term pattern than pasting the same procedural prompt into every thread.
