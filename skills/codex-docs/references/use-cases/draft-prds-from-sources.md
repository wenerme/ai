name: Draft PRDs from internal context
tagline: Create product requirements documents from Linear, Slack, source
  documents, and meeting notes.
summary: Use Codex with the $documents skill and connected apps such as Linear,
  Slack, Notion or Google Drive to create a reviewable PRD with the expected
  sections, a timeline, decisions, open questions, and a source appendix.

starterPrompt:
  title: Draft the PRD
  body: >-
    Use $documents to create a PRD for [feature or product area] from @linear
    [project or milestone], @slack [channel or thread], and @google-drive or
    @notion [planning docs, research notes, meeting notes, or source folder].


    Include the problem, users, goals/non-goals, requirements, UX, technical
    considerations, metrics, launch plan, risks, open questions, decisions,
    timeline, and source appendix.


    Cite the sources behind requirement-level claims. If sources disagree, call
    out the conflict instead of choosing silently. Draft only. Do not post,
    update Linear, or share the document until I approve it.

## Introduction

Before working on a new product or feature, it's common to draft a product requirements document (PRD) to align on the scope and requirements. Most often than not, the context needed to write that PRD is already available in the team's internal systems: tickets on Linear, discussions on Slack, drafts in Notion or Google Drive, etc. Codex can gather this context and draft a PRD that you can review and iterate on, while keeping the source trail visible.

## Choose the sources

Start with the sources you want Codex to use: the Linear project, the Slack planning channel or thread, and any Drive docs, Notion pages, meeting notes, or local files that should be cited in the PRD.
You should also clearly outline the PRD sections you expect, such as the problem, users, requirements, UX, tech, launch plan, timeline, or decisions.



1. Start with `$documents` when the output should be a real DOCX.
2. Name the sources directly: the Linear project or milestone, the Slack channel or thread, and the docs or notes Codex should cite.
3. Give Codex the PRD section contract.
4. Review the source appendix first, then the requirements and open questions.
5. Use the same thread to resolve gaps, tighten scope, and prepare the handoff.



## Refine in the same thread

Use the starter prompt on this page for the first draft. If something is missing, point Codex at the missing source instead of starting over.

## Check the source trail

Before sharing the PRD, ask Codex to list the claims with weak or missing support, the unresolved questions, and the decisions it treated as confirmed. If the source appendix does not make those easy to audit, keep refining the same thread before exporting or posting anything.
