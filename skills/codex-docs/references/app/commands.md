## Slash commands

Slash commands let you control Codex without leaving the thread composer. Available commands vary based on your environment and access.

### Use a slash command

1. In the thread composer, type `/`.
2. Select a command from the list, or keep typing to filter (for example, `/status`).

You can also explicitly invoke skills by typing `$` in the thread composer. See [Skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills).

Enabled skills also appear in the slash command list.

### Available slash commands

| Slash command | Description                                                                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/feedback`   | Open the feedback dialog to submit feedback and optionally include logs.               |
| `/goal`       | Set a persistent goal for Codex to work toward; use `/plan` first to shape it.         |
| `/mcp`        | Open MCP status to view connected servers.                                             |
| `/plan`       | Toggle plan mode for multi-step planning.                                              |
| `/review`     | Start code review mode to review uncommitted changes or compare against a base branch. |
| `/status`     | Show the thread ID, context usage, and rate limits.                                    |

### Set or manage a goal with `/goal`

Use `/goal` in the app composer to start Goal mode. A goal is a persistent
objective that Codex works toward until it finishes the task, pauses, or needs
more input. To define the goal with Codex first, start with `/plan`, then set
the refined goal with `/goal`.

If `/goal` doesn't appear in the slash command list, enable `features.goals`
in `config.toml`:

```toml
[features]
goals = true
```

You can also run `codex features enable goals` from the CLI or ask Codex to run it.

<CodexScreenshot
  alt="Codex app goal progress controls above the composer"
  lightSrc="/images/codex/app/goal-dialog-light.webp"
  darkSrc="/images/codex/app/goal-dialog-dark.webp"
  class="mb-6"
/>

When a goal is active, the app shows its progress above the composer. Use the
buttons in that progress row to pause or resume the goal, edit the goal text, or
clear the goal instead of typing another slash command. You can keep steering
Codex with follow-up messages while the goal runs.

For guidance on writing effective goals, see [Goal mode](https://developers.openai.com/codex/prompting#goal-mode).

## Deeplinks

The Codex app registers the `codex://` URL scheme so links can open specific parts of the app directly.

| Deeplink                      | Opens                                         | Supported query parameters               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `codex://settings`            | Settings.                                     | None.                                    |
| `codex://skills`              | Skills.                                       | None.                                    |
| `codex://automations`         | Inbox in automation create mode.              | None.                                    |
| `codex://threads/<thread-id>` | A local thread. `<thread-id>` must be a UUID. | None.                                    |
| `codex://new`                 | A new thread.                                 | Optional: `prompt`, `originUrl`, `path`. |

For new-thread deeplinks:

- `prompt` sets the initial composer text.
- `path` must be an absolute path to a local directory and, when valid, makes that directory the active workspace for the new thread.
- `originUrl` tries to match one of your current workspace roots by Git remote URL. If both `path` and `originUrl` are present, Codex resolves `path` first.
