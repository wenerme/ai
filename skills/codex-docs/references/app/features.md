# Codex app features

The Codex app is a focused desktop experience for working on Codex threads in parallel,
with built-in worktree support, automations, and Git functionality.

## Multitask across projects

Use one Codex app window to run tasks across projects. Add a project for each
codebase and switch between them as needed.

If you've used the [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli), a project is like starting a
session in a specific directory.

If you work in a single repository with two or more apps or packages, split
distinct projects into separate app projects so the [sandbox](https://developers.openai.com/codex/agent-approvals-security)
only includes the files for that project.

## Skills support

The Codex app supports the same [agent skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills) as the CLI and
IDE Extension. You can also view and explore new skills that your team has
created across your different projects by clicking Skills in the sidebar.

## Automations

You can also combine skills with [automations](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/automations) to perform routine tasks
such as evaluating errors in your telemetry and submitting fixes or creating reports on recent
codebase changes.

## Modes

Each thread runs in a selected mode. When starting a thread, you can choose:

- **Local**: work directly in your current project directory.
- **Worktree**: isolate changes in a Git worktree. [Learn more](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/worktrees).
- **Cloud**: run remotely in a configured cloud environment.

Both **Local** and **Worktree** threads will run on your computer.

For the full glossary and concepts, explore the [concepts section](https://developers.openai.com/codex/prompting).

## Built-in Git tools

The Codex app provides common Git features directly within the app.

The diff pane shows a Git diff of your changes in your local project or worktree checkout. You
can also add inline comments for Codex to address and stage or revert specific chunks or entire files.

You can also commit, push, and create pull requests for local and worktree tasks directly from
within the Codex app.

For more advanced Git tasks, use the [integrated terminal](#integrated-terminal).

/>

</section>

<section class="feature-grid inverse">

<div>

## Worktree support

When you create a new thread, choose **Local** or **Worktree**. **Local** works
directly within your project. **Worktree** creates a new [Git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) so changes stay isolated from your regular project.

Use **Worktree** when you want to try a new idea without touching your current
work, or when you want Codex to run independent tasks side by side in the same
project.

Automations run in dedicated background worktrees for Git repositories, and directly in the project directory for non-version-controlled projects.

## Integrated terminal

Each thread includes a built-in terminal scoped to the current project or
worktree. Toggle it using the terminal icon in the top right of the app or by
pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd>.

Use the terminal to validate changes, run scripts, and perform Git operations
without leaving the app. Codex can also read the current terminal output, so
it can check the status of a running development server or refer back to a
failed build while it works with you.

Common tasks include:

- `git status`
- `git pull --rebase`
- `pnpm test` or `npm test`
- `pnpm run lint` or similar project commands

If you run a task regularly, you can define an **action** inside your [local environment](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/local-environments) to add a shortcut button to the top of your Codex app window.

Note that <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> opens the command palette in the Codex
app. It doesn't clear the terminal. To clear the terminal use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd>.

## Native Windows sandbox

On Windows, Codex can run natively in PowerShell with a native Windows sandbox
instead of requiring WSL or a virtual machine. This lets you stay in
Windows-native workflows while keeping bounded permissions in place.

[Learn more about Windows setup and sandboxing](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/windows).

## Voice dictation

Use your voice to prompt Codex. Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> while the composer is visible and start talking. Your voice will be transcribed. Edit the transcribed prompt or hit send to have Codex start work.

</div>

## Floating pop-out window

Pop out an active conversation thread into a separate window and move it to where
you are actively working. This is ideal for front-end work, where you can keep
the thread near your browser, editor, or design preview while iterating quickly.

You can also toggle the pop-out window to stay on top when you want it to remain
visible across your workflow.

## Sync with the IDE extension

If you have the [Codex IDE Extension](https://developers.openai.com/codex/ide) installed in your editor,
your Codex app and IDE Extension automatically sync when both are in the same
project.

When they sync, you see an **IDE context** option in the Codex app composer. With "Auto context"
enabled, the Codex app tracks the files you're viewing, so you can reference them indirectly (for
example, "What's this file about?"). You can also see threads running in the Codex app inside the
IDE Extension, and vice versa.

If you're unsure whether the app includes context, toggle it off and ask the
same question again to compare results.

## Approvals and sandboxing

Your approval and sandbox settings constrain Codex actions.

- Approvals determine when Codex pauses for permission before running a command.
- The sandbox controls which directories and network access Codex can use.

When you see prompts like “approve once” or “approve for this session,” you are
granting different scopes of permission for tool execution. If you are unsure,
approve the narrowest option and continue iterating.

By default, Codex scopes work to the current project. In most cases, that's the
right constraint.

If your task requires work across more than one repository or directory, prefer
opening separate projects or using worktrees rather than asking Codex to roam
outside the project root.

For a high-level overview, see [Sandboxing](https://developers.openai.com/codex/concepts/sandboxing). For
configuration details, see the
[agent approvals & security documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/agent-approvals-security).

## MCP support

The Codex app, CLI, and IDE Extension share [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp) settings.
If you've already configured MCP servers in one, they're automatically adopted by the others. To
configure new servers, open the MCP section in the app's settings and either enable a recommended
server or add a new server to your configuration.

## Web search

Codex ships with a first-party web search tool. For local tasks in the Codex IDE Extension, Codex
enables web search by default and serves results from a web search cache. If you configure your
sandbox for [full access](https://developers.openai.com/codex/agent-approvals-security), web search defaults to live results. See
[Config basics](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-basic) to disable web search or switch to live results that fetch the
most recent data.

## Image input

You can drag and drop images into the prompt composer to include them as context. Hold down `Shift`
while dropping an image to add the image to the context.

You can also ask Codex to view images on your system. By giving Codex tools to take screenshots of
the app you are working on, Codex can verify the work it's doing.

## Notifications

By default, the Codex app sends notifications when a task completes or needs approval while the app
is in the background.

In the Codex app settings, you can choose to never send notifications or always send them, even
when the app is in focus.

## Keep your computer awake

Since your tasks might take a while to complete, you can have the Codex app prevent your computer
from going to sleep by enabling the "Prevent sleep while running" toggle in the app's settings.
