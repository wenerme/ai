# Error 410

## 410 Gone

When a resource is intentionally and permanently removed, servers use the `410 Gone` status code to inform clients that the resource is no longer available. In this case:

* The server suggests that links referencing the resource should be removed.
* The server is not obligated to use this status code instead of a `404` response, nor is it required to maintain this response for any specific period of time.

For more details, refer to [RFC 7231 ↗](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231).

### Common use cases

This status is commonly applied to deprecated content, such as outdated pages or discontinued products.

### Cloudflare-specific information

Cloudflare does not generate `410` for customer websites, we only proxy the request from the origin server. If you encounter a `410` error on a Cloudflare-powered site, the issue lies with the origin server. In such cases, contact your hosting provider for assistance.
