# Placement

By default, containers run in the location nearest to the incoming request with a pre-fetched image. Use placement constraints to restrict where your containers run for data residency, compliance, or latency requirements.

## Regional constraints

Use the `regions` constraint to limit container placement to specific geographic areas:

| Region | Description           | Notes            |
| ------ | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| ENAM   | Eastern North America |                  |
| WNAM   | Western North America |                  |
| EEUR   | Eastern Europe        |                  |
| WEUR   | Western Europe        |                  |
| APAC   | Asia Pacific          |                  |
| SAM    | South America         |                  |
| ME     | Middle East           | Limited capacity |
| OC     | Oceania               | Limited capacity |
| AFR    | Africa                | Limited capacity |

Limited capacity regions (ME, OC, AFR) cannot be used exclusively. Include at least one other region, or contact support for dedicated access.

## Jurisdictional constraints

Use the `jurisdiction` constraint to restrict containers to compliance boundaries:

| Jurisdiction | Regions    | Use case          |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------------- |
| eu           | EEUR, WEUR | EU data residency |
| fedramp      | ENAM, WNAM | FedRAMP regions   |

When you specify both `jurisdiction` and `regions`, the regions must be valid for that jurisdiction. For example, specifying `jurisdiction: "eu"` with `regions: ["ENAM"]` is invalid.

## Configure placement

Set placement constraints in your Wrangler configuration:

* [  wrangler.jsonc ](#tab-panel-7854)
* [  wrangler.toml ](#tab-panel-7855)

JSONC
