# Create a locally-managed tunnel

Follow this step-by-step guide to get your first tunnel up and running using the CLI.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you:

* [Add a website to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/).
* [Change your domain nameservers to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/).

## 1\. Download and install `cloudflared`

* [ Windows ](#tab-panel-8069)
* [ macOS ](#tab-panel-8070)
* [ Linux ](#tab-panel-8071)
* [ Build from source ](#tab-panel-8072)

1. Download `cloudflared` on your machine. Visit the [downloads](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/downloads/) page to find the right package for your OS.
2. Rename the executable to `cloudflared.exe`
3. In PowerShell, change directory to your Downloads folder and run `.\cloudflared.exe --version`. It should output the version of `cloudflared`. Note that `cloudflared.exe` could be `cloudflared-windows-amd64.exe` or `cloudflared-windows-386.exe` if you have not renamed it.  
PowerShell  
```  
PS C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\cloudflared-stable-windows-amd64> .\cloudflared.exe --version  
```

To download and install `cloudflared`:

Terminal window

```

brew install cloudflared


```

Alternatively, you can [download the latest Darwin amd64 release](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/downloads/) directly.

**Debian and Ubuntu APT**

Use the apt package manager to install `cloudflared` on compatible machines.

1. Add Cloudflare's package signing key:

Terminal window

```

sudo mkdir -p --mode=0755 /usr/share/keyrings

curl -fsSL https://pkg.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-main.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/cloudflare-main.gpg >/dev/null


```

1. Add Cloudflare's apt repo to your apt repositories:

Terminal window

```

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloudflare-main.gpg] https://pkg.cloudflare.com/cloudflared any main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudflared.list


```

1. Update repositories and install cloudflared:

Terminal window

```

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cloudflared


```

**RHEL RPM**

Use the rpm package manager to install `cloudflared` on compatible machines.

1. Add Cloudflare's repository:  
Terminal window  
```  
curl -fsSl https://pkg.cloudflare.com/cloudflared.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudflared.repo  
```
2. Update repositories and install cloudflared:  
Terminal window  
```  
sudo yum update && sudo yum install cloudflared  
```

**Arch Linux**

`cloudflared` is in the Arch Linux [community repository ↗](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/official%5Frepositories#community). Use `pacman` to install `cloudflared` on compatible machines.

Terminal window

```

pacman -Syu cloudflared


```

**Other**

Alternatively you can download the `cloudflared` binary or the linux packages to your machine and install manually. Visit the [downloads](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/downloads/) page to find the right package for your OS.

To build the latest version of `cloudflared` from source:

Terminal window

```

git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared.git

cd cloudflared

make cloudflared

go install github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/cmd/cloudflared


```

Depending on where you installed `cloudflared`, you can move it to a known path as well.

Terminal window

```

mv /root/cloudflared/cloudflared /usr/bin/cloudflared


```

## 2\. Authenticate `cloudflared`

Terminal window

```

cloudflared tunnel login


```

Running this command will:

* Open a browser window and prompt you to log in to your Cloudflare account. After logging in to your account, select your hostname.
* Generate an account certificate, the [cert.pem file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/advanced/local-management/local-tunnel-terms/#certpem), in the [default cloudflared directory](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/advanced/local-management/local-tunnel-terms/#default-cloudflared-directory).

## 3\. Create a tunnel and give it a name

Terminal window

```

cloudflared tunnel create <NAME>


```

Running this command will:

* Create a tunnel by establishing a persistent relationship between the name you provide and a UUID for your tunnel. At this point, no connection is active within the tunnel yet.
* Generate a [tunnel credentials file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/advanced/local-management/local-tunnel-terms/#credentials-file) in the [default cloudflared directory](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/advanced/local-management/local-tunnel-terms/#default-cloudflared-directory).
* Create a subdomain of `.cfargotunnel.com`.

From the output of the command, take note of the tunnel's UUID and the path to your tunnel's credentials file.

Confirm that the tunnel has been successfully created by running:

Terminal window

```

cloudflared tunnel list


```

## 4\. Create a configuration file

1. In your `.cloudflared` directory, create a [config.yml file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/advanced/local-management/configuration-file/) using any text editor. This file will configure the tunnel to route traffic from a given origin to the hostname of your choice.
2. Add the following fields to the file:  
```  
url: http://localhost:8000  
tunnel: <Tunnel-UUID>  
credentials-file: /root/.cloudflared/<Tunnel-UUID>.json  
```
3. Confirm that the configuration file has been successfully created by running:  
Terminal window  
```  
cat config.yml  
```

## 5\. Start routing traffic

To route a [published application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/routing/) through the tunnel:

Terminal window

```

cloudflared tunnel route dns <UUID or NAME> <hostname>


```

This command will create a `CNAME` record pointing to `<UUID>.cfargotunnel.com`.

## 6\. Run the tunnel

Run the tunnel to proxy incoming traffic from the tunnel to any number of services running locally on your origin.

Terminal window

```

cloudflared tunnel run <UUID or NAME>


```

If your configuration file has a custom name or is not in the `.cloudflared` directory, add the `--config` flag and specify the path.

Terminal window

```

cloudflared tunnel --config /path/your-config-file.yml run <UUID or NAME>


```

Note

Cloudflare Tunnel can install itself as a system service on Linux and Windows and as a launch agent on macOS. For more information, refer to [run as a service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/advanced/local-management/as-a-service/).

## 7\. Check the tunnel

To get information on the tunnel you just created, run:

Terminal window

```

cloudflared tunnel info <UUID or NAME>


```
