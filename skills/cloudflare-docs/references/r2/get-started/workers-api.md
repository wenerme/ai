# Workers API

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) let you run code at the edge. When you bind an R2 bucket to a Worker, you can read and write objects directly using the [Workers API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/workers/workers-api-usage/).

## 1\. Create a bucket

A bucket stores your objects in R2\. To create a new R2 bucket:

* [ Wrangler CLI ](#tab-panel-8245)
* [ Dashboard ](#tab-panel-8246)

1. Log in to your Cloudflare account:  
Terminal window  
```  
npx wrangler login  
```
2. Create a bucket named `my-bucket`:  
Terminal window  
```  
npx wrangler r2 bucket create my-bucket  
```  
If prompted, select the account you want to create the bucket in.
3. Verify the bucket was created:  
Terminal window  
```  
npx wrangler r2 bucket list  
```

1. In the Cloudflare Dashboard, go to **R2 object storage**.  
[ Go to **Overview** ](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2/overview)
2. Select **Create bucket**.
3. Enter a name for your bucket.
4. Select a [location](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/reference/data-location) for your bucket and a [default storage class](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/storage-classes/).
5. Select **Create bucket**.

## 2\. Create a Worker with an R2 binding

1. Create a new Worker project:  
 npm  yarn  pnpm  
```  
npm create cloudflare@latest -- r2-worker  
```  
```  
yarn create cloudflare r2-worker  
```  
```  
pnpm create cloudflare@latest r2-worker  
```  
When prompted, select **Hello World example** and **JavaScript** (or TypeScript) as your template.
2. Move into the project directory:  
Terminal window  
```  
cd r2-worker  
```
3. Add an R2 binding to your Wrangler configuration file. Replace `my-bucket` with your bucket name:  
   * [  wrangler.jsonc ](#tab-panel-8247)  
   * [  wrangler.toml ](#tab-panel-8248)  
JSONC  
```  
{  
  "r2_buckets": [  
    {  
      "binding": "MY_BUCKET",  
      "bucket_name": "my-bucket"  
    }  
  ]  
}  
```  
TOML  
```  
[[r2_buckets]]  
binding = "MY_BUCKET"  
bucket_name = "my-bucket"  
```
4. (Optional) If you are using TypeScript, regenerate types:  
Terminal window  
```  
npx wrangler types  
```

## 3\. Read and write objects

Use the binding to interact with your bucket. This example stores and retrieves objects based on the URL path:

* [ JavaScript ](#tab-panel-8243)
* [ TypeScript ](#tab-panel-8244)

src/index.js

```

export default {

  async fetch(request, env) {

    // Get the object key from the URL path

    // For example: /images/cat.png → images/cat.png

    const url = new URL(request.url);

    const key = url.pathname.slice(1);


    // PUT: Store the request body in R2

    if (request.method === "PUT") {

      await env.MY_BUCKET.put(key, request.body);

      return new Response(`Put ${key} successfully!`);

    }


    // GET: Retrieve the object from R2

    const object = await env.MY_BUCKET.get(key);

    if (object === null) {

      return new Response("Object not found", { status: 404 });

    }

    return new Response(object.body);

  },

};


```

Explain Code

src/index.ts

```

export default {

  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {

    // Get the object key from the URL path

    // For example: /images/cat.png → images/cat.png

    const url = new URL(request.url);

    const key = url.pathname.slice(1);


    // PUT: Store the request body in R2

    if (request.method === "PUT") {

      await env.MY_BUCKET.put(key, request.body);

      return new Response(`Put ${key} successfully!`);

    }


    // GET: Retrieve the object from R2

    const object = await env.MY_BUCKET.get(key);

    if (object === null) {

      return new Response("Object not found", { status: 404 });

    }

    return new Response(object.body);

  },

} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;


```

Explain Code

## 4\. Test and deploy

1. Test your Worker locally:  
Terminal window  
```  
npx wrangler dev  
```  
Local development  
By default, `wrangler dev` uses a local R2 simulation. Objects you store during development exist only on your machine in the `.wrangler/state` folder and do not affect your production bucket.  
To connect to your real R2 bucket during development, add `"remote": true` to your R2 binding in your Wrangler configuration file. Refer to [remote bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/development-testing/#remote-bindings) for more information.
2. Once the dev server is running, test storing and retrieving objects:  
Terminal window  
```  
# Store an object  
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8787/my-file.txt -d 'Hello, R2!'  
# Retrieve the object  
curl http://localhost:8787/my-file.txt  
```
3. Deploy to production:  
Terminal window  
```  
npx wrangler deploy  
```
4. After deploying, Wrangler outputs your Worker's URL (for example, `https://r2-worker.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`). Test storing and retrieving objects:  
Terminal window  
```  
# Store an object  
curl -X PUT https://r2-worker.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev/my-file.txt -d 'Hello, R2!'  
# Retrieve the object  
curl https://r2-worker.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev/my-file.txt  
```

Refer to the [Workers R2 API documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/workers/workers-api-usage/) for the complete API reference.
