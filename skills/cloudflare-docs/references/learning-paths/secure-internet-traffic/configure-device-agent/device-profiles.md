# Customize device profiles

A device profile defines [Cloudflare One Client settings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/settings/) for a specific set of devices in your organization. You can create multiple profiles and apply different settings based on the user's identity, the device's location, and other criteria.

For example, users in one identity provider group (signifying a specific office location) might have different routes that need to be excluded from their WARP tunnel, or some device types (like Linux) might need different DNS settings to accommodate local development services.

## Configure the default profile

Set your default device profile to be applicable to a majority of your userbase, or any user without known explicit considerations.

To customize the default settings:

* [ Dashboard ](#tab-panel-5351)
* [ API ](#tab-panel-5352)
* [ Terraform (v5) ](#tab-panel-5353)

1. In [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Team & Resources** \> **Devices** \> **Device profiles** \> **General profiles**.
2. Select the **Default** profile and select \*_Edit_.
3. Many users running Cloudflare Zero Trust to secure their organization have a default profile that resembles the following. Refer to [Cloudflare One Client settings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/settings/) for a description of each setting.

4. Save the profile.
5. Configure [global settings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/settings/#global-settings) for all device profiles:  
   1. (Recommended) Enable **Admin override code** if you turned on **Lock device client switch**.  
   2. Enable **Install CA to system certificate store** if you want users to see a [custom block page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/custom-pages/gateway-block-page/).

1. Update the default device settings profile:

Terminal window

```

curl --request PATCH \

https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/devices/policy \

--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \

--header "Content-Type: application/json" \

--data '{

  "allow_mode_switch": false,

  "allow_updates": false,

  "allowed_to_leave": false,

  "auto_connect": 900,

  "captive_portal": 180,

  "disable_auto_fallback": true,

  "exclude_office_ips": false,

  "service_mode_v2": {

    "mode": "warp"

  },

  "support_url": "https://it.company.com/help",

  "switch_locked": true

}'


```

Explain Code

1. Update global settings:

Terminal window

```

curl --request PUT \

https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/devices/settings \

--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \

--header "Content-Type: application/json" \

--data '{

  "disable_for_time": 3600,

  "root_certificate_installation_enabled": true

}'


```

1. Add the following permission to your [cloudflare\_api\_token ↗](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/api%5Ftoken):  
   * `Zero Trust Write`
2. Configure default profile settings using the [cloudflare\_zero\_trust\_device\_default\_profile ↗](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero%5Ftrust%5Fdevice%5Fdefault%5Fprofile) resource:  
```

  allow_updates         = false  
  allowed_to_leave      = false

  captive_portal        = 180  
  disable_auto_fallback = true  
  exclude_office_ips    = false  
  service_mode_v2       = {mode = "warp"}  
  support_url           = "https://support.example.com"  
  switch_locked         = true  
  tunnel_protocol       = "wireguard"  
}  
```  
Explain Code
3. Configure [global settings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/settings/#global-settings) using the [cloudflare\_zero\_trust\_device\_settings ↗](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero%5Ftrust%5Fdevice%5Fsettings) resource:  
```  
resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_device_settings" "global_warp_settings" {  
  account_id            = var.cloudflare_account_id  
  disable_for_time      = 3600  
  root_certificate_installation_enabled = true  
  use_zt_virtual_ip     = false  
}  
```

## (Optional) Create an office profile

You can configure a device settings profile to take effect when the device is connected to a trusted network such as an office. For example, you may wish to allow users in the office to access applications directly rather than route traffic through Cloudflare.

For setup instructions, refer to [Add a managed network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/managed-networks/).
