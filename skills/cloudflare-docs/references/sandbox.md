# Sandbox SDK (Beta)

Build secure, isolated code execution environments

 Available on Workers Paid plan 

The Sandbox SDK enables you to run untrusted code securely in isolated environments. Built on [Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/), Sandbox SDK provides a simple API for executing commands, managing files, running background processes, and exposing services — all from your [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) applications.

Sandboxes are ideal for building AI agents that need to execute code, interactive development environments, data analysis platforms, CI/CD systems, and any application that needs secure code execution at the edge. Each sandbox runs in its own isolated container with a full Linux environment, providing strong security boundaries while maintaining performance.

With Sandbox, you can execute Python scripts, run Node.js applications, analyze data, compile code, and perform complex computations — all with a simple TypeScript API and no infrastructure to manage.

TypeScript

```

import { getSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';


export { Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';


export default {

  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {

    // Connect to WebSocket services in sandbox

    if (request.headers.get('Upgrade')?.toLowerCase() === 'websocket') {

      const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'user-123');

      return await sandbox.wsConnect(request, 8080);

    }
