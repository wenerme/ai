# Commands

## How to run Wrangler commands

```

wrangler <COMMAND> <SUBCOMMAND> [PARAMETERS] [OPTIONS]


```

Since Cloudflare recommends [installing Wrangler locally](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) in your project (rather than globally), the way to run Wrangler will depend on your specific setup and package manager.

 npm  yarn  pnpm 

```
npx wrangler <COMMAND> <SUBCOMMAND> [PARAMETERS] [OPTIONS]
```

```
yarn wrangler <COMMAND> <SUBCOMMAND> [PARAMETERS] [OPTIONS]
```

```
pnpm wrangler <COMMAND> <SUBCOMMAND> [PARAMETERS] [OPTIONS]
```

You can add Wrangler commands that you use often as scripts in your project's `package.json` file:

```

{

  ...

  "scripts": {

    "deploy": "wrangler deploy",

    "dev": "wrangler dev"

  }

  ...

}


```

You can then run them using your package manager of choice:

 npm  yarn  pnpm 

```
npm run deploy
```

```
yarn run deploy
```

```
pnpm run deploy
```

```json
{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BreadcrumbList","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"item":{"@id":"/directory/","name":"Directory"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"item":{"@id":"/workers/","name":"Workers"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"item":{"@id":"/workers/wrangler/","name":"Wrangler"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":4,"item":{"@id":"/workers/wrangler/commands/","name":"Commands"}}]}
```
