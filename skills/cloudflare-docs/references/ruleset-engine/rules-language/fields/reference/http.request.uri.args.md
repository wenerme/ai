#  http.request.uri.args 

`http.request.uri.args` ` Map<Array<String>> ` 

The HTTP URI arguments associated with a request represented as a Map (associative array).

When an argument repeats, the array contains multiple items in the order they appear in the request.

The values are not pre-processed and retain the original case used in the request.

* **Decoding**: No decoding performed
* **Non-ASCII**: Preserved

Example value:

```

{"search": ["red+apples"]}


```

Example usage:

```

any(http.request.uri.args["search"][*] == "red+apples")


```
