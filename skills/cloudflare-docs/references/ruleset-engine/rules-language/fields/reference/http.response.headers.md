#  http.response.headers 

`http.response.headers` ` Map<Array<String>> ` 

The HTTP response headers represented as a Map (or associative array).

When there are repeating headers, the array includes them in the order they appear in the response. The keys convert to lowercase.

```

any(http.response.headers["server"][*] == "nginx")


```
