# High availability

For production deployments, you can run multiple replicas of a Mesh node in active-passive mode. All replicas share the same node identity and advertise the same [routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-mesh/routes/). If the active replica goes down, Cloudflare automatically promotes a standby replica.

## When to use high availability

High availability provides resilience for CIDR route prefixes advertised by a Mesh node. When the active replica disconnects, Cloudflare promotes a standby so that traffic to the advertised subnets continues to flow.

This means HA is useful for nodes that have routes configured — nodes acting as subnet gateways for private networks behind them. If a node is only used for direct Mesh IP connectivity (no routes), HA has limited benefit because the node's Mesh IP is tied to the individual replica.

## How it works

When you create a Mesh node with high availability enabled, Cloudflare generates a single token for that node. You install the Cloudflare One Client on multiple Linux hosts using this token. Each host registers as a replica of the same node.

* All replicas advertise the same CIDR routes.
* One replica is active at a time. The others are passive standby.
* If the active replica disconnects, Cloudflare automatically promotes a passive replica.
* Failover is handled by Cloudflare's network.

## Create a node with high availability

* [ Dashboard ](#tab-panel-6147)
* [ API ](#tab-panel-6148)

When you create a Mesh node through the dashboard, high availability is enabled by default. To create a new node:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Networking** \> **Mesh**.  
[ Go to **Mesh** ](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/mesh)
2. Select **Add a node**.
3. Follow the setup wizard. The node is created with HA enabled automatically.
4. Copy the install commands and run them on your Linux host.

To create a node with high availability via the API, set `ha: true` in the request body:

Terminal window

```

curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/warp_connector" \

  -H "Authorization: Bearer {api_token}" \

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

  -d '{

    "name": "web-server",

    "ha": true

  }'


```

The response includes a `token` field. Use this token to register replicas.

## Add replicas

To add a replica to an existing high-availability node, install the Cloudflare One Client on a new Linux host and register it using the same node token.

* [ Dashboard ](#tab-panel-6155)
* [ API ](#tab-panel-6156)

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Networking** \> **Mesh**.  
[ Go to **Mesh** ](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/mesh)
2. Select your Mesh node.
3. Select **Add a replica**.
4. A dialog shows the install commands and the node's token.
5. On a new Linux host, run the install commands shown in the dialog.

Installation commands

* [ Debian / Ubuntu ](#tab-panel-6151)
* [ RedHat / CentOS ](#tab-panel-6152)

Terminal window

```

curl -fsSL https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/pubkey.gpg | sudo gpg --yes --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/cloudflare-warp-archive-keyring.gpg &&

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloudflare-warp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/ $(. /etc/os-release && echo $VERSION_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudflare-client.list &&

sudo apt-get update -qq && sudo apt-get install -y -qq cloudflare-warp &&

printf 'net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra = 2\n' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-zzz-cloudflare-warp-connector.conf &&

sudo sysctl --system


```

Terminal window

```

sudo warp-cli connector new <TOKEN> && sudo warp-cli connect


```

On RHEL 9 and later, enable the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository before installing `cloudflare-warp`. EPEL provides dependencies required by the Cloudflare One Client UI:

Terminal window

```

sudo dnf install -y epel-release


```

Then install the package:

Terminal window

```

curl -fsSl https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/cloudflare-warp-ascii.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudflare-warp.repo &&

sudo yum install -y cloudflare-warp &&

printf 'net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra = 2\n' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-zzz-cloudflare-warp-connector.conf &&

sudo sysctl --system


```

Terminal window

```

sudo warp-cli connector new <TOKEN> && sudo warp-cli connect


```

1. Retrieve the node's token:  
Terminal window  
```  
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/warp_connector/{node_id}/token" \  
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {api_token}"  
```  
The response contains the token string.
2. Install the client and register on a new Linux host:  
   * [ Debian / Ubuntu ](#tab-panel-6153)  
   * [ RedHat / CentOS ](#tab-panel-6154)  
Terminal window  
```  
curl -fsSL https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/pubkey.gpg | sudo gpg --yes --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/cloudflare-warp-archive-keyring.gpg &&  
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloudflare-warp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/ $(. /etc/os-release && echo $VERSION_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudflare-client.list &&  
sudo apt-get update -qq && sudo apt-get install -y -qq cloudflare-warp &&  
printf 'net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra = 2\n' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-zzz-cloudflare-warp-connector.conf &&  
sudo sysctl --system  
```  
Terminal window  
```  
sudo warp-cli connector new <TOKEN> && sudo warp-cli connect  
```  
On RHEL 9 and later, enable the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository before installing `cloudflare-warp`. EPEL provides dependencies required by the Cloudflare One Client UI:  
Terminal window  
```  
sudo dnf install -y epel-release  
```  
Then install the package:  
Terminal window  
```  
curl -fsSl https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/cloudflare-warp-ascii.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudflare-warp.repo &&  
sudo yum install -y cloudflare-warp &&  
printf 'net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra = 2\n' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-zzz-cloudflare-warp-connector.conf &&  
sudo sysctl --system  
```  
Terminal window  
```  
sudo warp-cli connector new <TOKEN> && sudo warp-cli connect  
```

The new replica will be in standby mode until the active replica disconnects.

## View replicas

* [ Dashboard ](#tab-panel-6145)
* [ API ](#tab-panel-6146)

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Networking** \> **Mesh**.  
[ Go to **Mesh** ](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/mesh)
2. Select an HA-enabled node. HA nodes display an **HA** badge in the overview table.
3. The node detail page shows a tab for each replica. Each tab displays:  
   * **Active** or **Passive** badge  
   * Mesh IP (IPv4 and IPv6)  
   * Edge data center  
   * Origin IP  
   * Platform, version, and device name  
   * Connected since timestamp

To view all replicas and their HA status, query the connections API endpoint:

Terminal window

```

curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/warp_connector/{node_id}/connections" \

  -H "Authorization: Bearer {api_token}"


```

The response includes each replica with its `ha_status` (`active` or `passive`), connection details, and the Cloudflare data center it is connected to:

```

{

  "success": true,

  "result": [

    {

      "id": "bf69f118-238e-11f1-b113-ee02f3be4a5b",

      "conns": [

        {

          "colo_name": "lhr16",

          "origin_ip": "34.105.147.200",

          "opened_at": "2026-03-19T12:25:47.400Z"

        }

      ],

      "run_at": "2026-03-19T12:25:47.400Z",

      "ha_status": "active"

    },

    {

      "id": "e07272a6-21fc-11f1-8997-e28f01ba3991",

      "conns": [

        {

          "colo_name": "lhr14",

          "origin_ip": "35.246.81.139",

          "opened_at": "2026-03-19T02:38:37.203Z"

        }

      ],

      "run_at": "2026-03-19T02:38:37.203Z",

      "ha_status": "passive"

    }

  ]

}


```

## Manual failover

In addition to automatic failover when the active replica disconnects, you can manually promote a passive replica to active.

* [ Dashboard ](#tab-panel-6149)
* [ API ](#tab-panel-6150)

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Networking** \> **Mesh**.  
[ Go to **Mesh** ](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/mesh)
2. Select an HA-enabled node.
3. Select the tab for the passive replica you want to promote.
4. Select **Promote to active**.
5. In the confirmation dialog, select **Promote to active** to confirm.

Traffic reroutes to the promoted replica immediately. The previous active replica switches to passive standby.

To manually trigger failover, send a `PUT` request with the `client_id` of the replica you want to promote:

Terminal window

```

curl -X PUT "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/warp_connector/{node_id}/failover" \

  -H "Authorization: Bearer {api_token}" \

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

  -d '{

    "client_id": "e07272a6-21fc-11f1-8997-e28f01ba3991"

  }'


```

Get the `client_id` from the [connections endpoint](#view-replicas). Use the `id` field of the replica you want to promote.

## Considerations

### Setup requirements

* High availability is set at node creation time and cannot be changed afterward.
* You must install the client on at least two hosts for failover to work. A single replica means no redundancy.
* High availability requires the MASQUE transport protocol. WireGuard does not support HA. Mesh nodes use MASQUE by default.

### Network configuration

* All replicas must be on the same subnet and have the same network routing configuration (Split Tunnels, static routes).
* HA provides resilience for CIDR route prefixes. Nodes without routes do not benefit from HA failover.

### Failover behavior

* Failover time depends on how quickly Cloudflare detects the active replica has disconnected (typically seconds).
* Inbound traffic (from Mesh clients to the subnet) fails over automatically on Cloudflare's network. Cloudflare routes traffic to the newly promoted active replica.
* Outbound traffic (from devices on the subnet through the Mesh node) does not fail over automatically. Your environment must detect that a different replica has been promoted to active and update routing tables to send traffic through the now-active host. There is no client-side failover for on-ramp traffic at this time.
