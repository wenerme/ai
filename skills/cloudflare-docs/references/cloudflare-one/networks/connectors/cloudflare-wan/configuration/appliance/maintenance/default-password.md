# Default password

Cloudflare One Appliance (formerly Magic WAN Connector) ships to you with a default password that enables you to access the hardware box or the virtual machine. Cloudflare recommends that you change this password after the first boot.

## Default password to access hardware Cloudflare One Appliance

The default password for Cloudflare One Appliance is the serial number (also known as a Service Tag for Dell devices), all uppercase followed by an `!` (exclamation mark). For example, `A1B2C3D!`

## Default password to access Virtual Appliance

The default password for Virtual Appliance is the last seven characters of your license key, all uppercase, plus an `!` (exclamation mark).

For example, if your license key is `mconn-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`, your default password will be `TUVWXYZ!`.
