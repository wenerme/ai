# Common policies

The following policies are commonly used to secure HTTP traffic. HTTP policies are evaluated in order from top to bottom, and the first matching policy applies — except for [Do Not Inspect](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/#do-not-inspect) policies, which are always evaluated first.

For a baseline set of recommended policies, refer to [Secure your Internet traffic and SaaS apps](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/secure-internet-traffic/build-http-policies/recommended-http-policies/).

Refer to the [HTTP policies page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/) for a comprehensive list of other selectors, operators, and actions.

## Block sites

Block attempts to reach sites by hostname or URL paths. Different approaches may be required based on how a site is organized.

### Block sites by hostname

Block all subdomains that use a host.

* [ Dashboard ](#tab-panel-3829)
* [ API ](#tab-panel-3830)

| Selector | Operator      | Value            | Action |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| Host     | matches regex | .\*example\\.com | Block  |

In the following API examples, `filters: ["http"]` indicates that this is an HTTP (Layer 7) policy.

Create a Zero Trust Gateway rule

```

curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/gateway/rules" \

  --request POST \

  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \

  --json '{

    ],

    "traffic": "http.request.host matches \".*example.com\"",

    "identity": "",

    "device_posture": ""

  }'


```

### Block sites by URL

Block a section of a site without blocking the entire site. For example, you can block a specific subreddit, such as `reddit.com/r/gaming`, without blocking `reddit.com`.

* [ Dashboard ](#tab-panel-3827)
* [ API ](#tab-panel-3828)

| Selector | Operator      | Value     | Action |

## Block unauthorized applications

Note

After seven days, view your [Shadow IT SaaS Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/analytics/shadow-it-discovery/) and block additional applications based on what your users are accessing.

To minimize the risk of [shadow IT](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-shadow-it/), some organizations choose to limit their users' access to certain web-based tools and applications. For example, the following policy blocks known AI tools:

* [ Dashboard ](#tab-panel-3860)
* [ API ](#tab-panel-3861)
* [ Terraform ](#tab-panel-3862)

| Selector    | Operator | Value                     | Action |

```

## Check user identity

Configure access on a per user or group basis by adding [identity-based conditions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/identity-selectors/) to your policies.

* [ Dashboard ](#tab-panel-3831)
* [ API ](#tab-panel-3832)

| Selector         | Operator | Value         | Logic | Action |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------- | ----- | ------ |

    "device_posture": ""

  }'


```

## Skip inspection for groups of applications

Certain client applications, such as Zoom or Apple services, rely on certificate pinning. These applications verify they are connecting directly to their own servers and will reject Gateway's TLS inspection certificate. To avoid connection errors, you must add a Do Not Inspect HTTP policy for these applications.

Gateway [evaluates Do Not Inspect policies first](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/order-of-enforcement/#http-policies), regardless of their position in the policy list. Cloudflare recommends moving your Do Not Inspect policies to the top of the list to reduce confusion.

* [ Dashboard ](#tab-panel-3833)
* [ API ](#tab-panel-3834)

| Selector    | Operator | Value            | Action         |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Application | in       | _Do Not Inspect_ | Do Not Inspect |

Create a Zero Trust Gateway rule

```

curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/gateway/rules" \

  --request POST \

  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \

  --json '{

    "name": "Bypass incompatible applications",

    "description": "Skip TLS decryption for applications that are incompatible with Gateway",

    "enabled": true,

    "action": "off",

    "filters": [

        "http"

    ],

    "traffic": "any(app.type.ids[*] in {16})",

    "identity": "",

    "device_posture": ""

  }'


```

Note

You can select either individual applications or the entire Do Not Inspect set, which will update as new applications are added.

## Check device posture

Require devices to have certain software installed or other configuration attributes. For instructions on setting up a device posture check, refer to [Enforce device posture](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/posture-checks/).

### Enforce a minimum OS version

Perform an [OS version check](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/posture-checks/client-checks/os-version/) to ensure users are running at least a minimum version.

* [ Dashboard ](#tab-panel-3835)
* [ API ](#tab-panel-3836)

| Selector                     | Operator | Value                | Action |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| Passed Device Posture Checks | in       | _Minimum OS version_ | Allow  |

Create a Zero Trust Gateway rule

```

curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/gateway/rules" \

  --request POST \

  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \

  --json '{

    "name": "Require OS version",

    "description": "Perform an OS version check for minimum version",

    "enabled": true,

    "action": "allow",

    "filters": [

        "http"

    ],

    "traffic": "",

    "identity": "",

    "device_posture": "any(device_posture.checks.passed[*] in {\"<POSTURE_CHECK_UUID>\"})"

  }'


```

To get the UUIDs of your device posture checks, use the [List device posture rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/zero%5Ftrust/subresources/devices/subresources/posture/methods/list/) endpoint.

### Check for a specific file

Perform a [file check](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/posture-checks/client-checks/file-check/) to ensure users have a certain file on their device.

Since the file path will be different for each operating system, you can configure a file check for each system and use the **Or** logical operator to only require one of the checks to pass.

* [ Dashboard ](#tab-panel-3839)
* [ API ](#tab-panel-3840)

| Selector                     | Operator | Value              | Logic | Action |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ----- | ------ |
| Passed Device Posture Checks | in       | _macOS File Check_ | Or    | Allow  |
| Passed Device Posture Checks | in       | _Linux File Check_ |       |        |

  }'


```

To get the UUIDs of your device posture checks, use the [List device posture rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/zero%5Ftrust/subresources/devices/subresources/posture/methods/list/) endpoint.

## Enforce session duration

[Require users to re-authenticate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/client-sessions/) after a certain amount of time has elapsed.

## Isolate high risk sites in remote browser

If you are using the [Browser Isolation add-on](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/), refer to our list of [common Isolate policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/isolation-policies/#common-policies).

## Bypass inspection for self-signed certificates

When accessing origin servers with certificates not signed by a public certificate authority, you must bypass TLS decryption.

Gateway does not inspect or log [WebSocket ↗](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) traffic. Instead, Gateway will only log the HTTP details used to make the WebSocket connection, as well as [network session information](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/zero%5Ftrust%5Fnetwork%5Fsessions/). To filter your WebSocket traffic, create a policy with the `101` HTTP response code.
