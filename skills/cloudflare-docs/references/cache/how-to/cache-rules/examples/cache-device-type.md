# Cache by Device Type

Cache by Device Type

Note

If you are migrating from Page Rules and you want to keep Page Rules behavior, you need to create two specific rules before creating this rule. For more details refer to [Migration from Page Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/page-rules-migration/).

[Create a cache rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/create-dashboard/) to cache content based on user agent or device type for any hostname containing `example.com`:

* **When incoming requests match**: Custom filter expression  
   * Using the Expression Builder:  
   `Hostname contains "example.com"`  
   * Using the Expression Editor:  
   `(http.host contains "example.com")`
* **Then**:  
   * **Cache eligibility**: Eligible for cache  
   * **Setting**: Cache key  
         * **Cache by device type**: On
