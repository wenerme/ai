## Geo Key Manager v2 Beta

Note

Geo Key Manager v2 is only available through the Cloudflare API.

Geo Key Manager v2 gives customers flexibility when choosing the geographical boundaries of where their keys are stored.

Using the `policy` field, customers can define policies containing allow and block lists of countries or regions where the private key should be stored.

To use Geo Key Manager v2 with the API, generally, follow the steps to [upload a custom certificate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/uploading/#upload-a-custom-certificate).

When sending the [POST](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/custom%5Fcertificates/methods/create/) request, include the `policy` parameter to define policies containing allow and block lists of countries or regions where the private key should be stored.

Note

You also have access to the `geo_restrictions` parameter, which is mutually exclusive with the `policy` parameter and is part of [Geo Key Manager v1](#geo-key-manager-v1).

### Examples

Store private keys in the E.U. and the U.S.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/)is required:
* `Access: Mutual TLS Certificates Write`
* `SSL and Certificates Write`

Create SSL Configuration

```

curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/custom_certificates" \

  --request POST \

  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \

  --json '{

    "certificate": "certificate",

    "private_key": "<PRIVATE_KEY>",

    "policy": "(country: US) and (region: EU)",

    "type": "sni_custom"

  }'


```

Store private keys in the E.U., but not in France

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/)is required:
* `Access: Mutual TLS Certificates Write`
