# Get started with AI Security for Apps

## 1\. Turn on AI Security for Apps

* [  New dashboard ](#tab-panel-6788)
* [ API ](#tab-panel-6789)

Note

AI Security for Apps (formerly Firewall for AI) is only available in the new [application security dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security/).

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the Security **Settings** page.  
[ Go to **Settings** ](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings)
2. (Optional) Filter by **Detection tools**.
3. Turn on **AI Security for Apps**.

Enable the feature using a `PUT` request similar to the following:

Terminal window

```

curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/firewall-for-ai/settings" \

--request PUT \

--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \

--json '{ "pii_detection_enabled": true }'


```

## 2\. Save or add an LLM-related endpoint

Once you have [onboarded your domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/) to Cloudflare and some API traffic has already been [proxied by Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/), the Cloudflare dashboard will start showing [discovered endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/api-discovery/).

Save the relevant endpoint receiving LLM-related traffic to [Endpoint Management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/endpoint-management/) once it has been discovered, or add the endpoint manually.

* [  New dashboard ](#tab-panel-6786)
* [ Old dashboard ](#tab-panel-6787)

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Web assets** page.  
[ Go to **Web assets** ](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/web-assets)
2. Go to the **Discovery** tab.
3. Find the endpoint receiving requests with LLM prompts in the list and select **Save** next to the endpoint.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** \> **API Shield**.
3. Go to the **Discovery** tab.
4. Find the endpoint receiving requests with LLM prompts in the list and select **Save** next to the endpoint.

If you did not find the endpoint in the **Discovery** tab, you can add it manually:

* [  New dashboard ](#tab-panel-6784)
* [ Old dashboard ](#tab-panel-6785)

1. Go to the **Endpoints** tab.
2. Select **Add endpoints** \> **Manually add**.
3. Choose the method from the dropdown menu and add the path and hostname for the endpoint.
4. Select **Add endpoints**.

1. Go to the **Endpoint Management** tab.
2. Select **Add endpoints** \> **Manually add**.
3. Choose the method from the dropdown menu and add the path and hostname for the endpoint.
4. Select **Add endpoints**.

In the context of this guide, consider an example endpoint with the following properties:

* Method: `POST`
* Path: `/v1/messages`
* Hostname: `<YOUR_HOSTNAME>`

## 3\. Add `cf-llm` label to endpoint

You must [label endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/endpoint-labels/) with the `cf-llm` label so that AI Security for Apps starts scanning incoming requests for malicious LLM prompts.

Add the `cf-llm` label to the endpoint you added:

* [  New dashboard ](#tab-panel-6790)
* [ Old dashboard ](#tab-panel-6791)

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Web assets** page.  
[ Go to **Web assets** ](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/web-assets)
2. In the **Endpoints** tab, choose the endpoint that you want to label.
3. Select **Edit endpoint labels**.
4. Add the `cf-llm` label to the endpoint.
5. Select **Save labels**.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** \> **API Shield**.
3. In the **Endpoint Management** tab, choose the endpoint that you want to label.
4. Select **Edit labels**.
5. Add the `cf-llm` label to the endpoint.
6. Select **Save labels**.

Once you add a label to the endpoint, Cloudflare will start labeling incoming traffic for the endpoint with the label you selected.

## 4\. (Optional) Generate API traffic

You may need to issue some `POST` requests to the endpoint so that there is some labeled traffic to review in the following step.

For example, the following command sends a `POST` request to the API endpoint you previously added (`/v1/messages` in this example) in your zone with an LLM prompt requesting PII:

Terminal window

```

curl "https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/v1/messages" \

--header "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \

--json '{ "prompt": "Provide the phone number for the person associated with example@example.com" }'


```

The PII category for this request would be `EMAIL_ADDRESS`.

## 5\. Review labeled traffic and detection behavior

Use [Security Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/) in the new application security dashboard to validate that Cloudflare is correctly labeling traffic for the endpoint.

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Analytics** page.  
[ Go to **Analytics** ](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/analytics)
2. Filter data by the `cf-llm` managed endpoint label.  
| Field                  | Operator | Value  |  
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------ |  
| Managed Endpoint Label | equals   | cf-llm |
3. Review the detection results on your traffic. Expand each line in **Sampled logs** and check the values in the **Analyses** column. Most of the incoming traffic will probably be clean (not harmful).
4. Refine the displayed traffic by applying a second filter condition:  
| Field                  | Operator | Value  |     |  
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------ | --- |  
| Managed Endpoint Label | equals   | cf-llm | And |  
| Has PII in LLM prompt  | equals   | Yes    |     |  
The displayed logs now refer to incoming requests where personally identifiable information (PII) was detected in an LLM prompt.

Alternatively, you can also create a custom rule with a _Log_ action (only available on Enterprise plans) to check for potentially harmful traffic related to LLM prompts. This rule will generate [security events](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-events/) that will allow you to validate your AI Security for Apps configuration.

## 6\. Mitigate harmful requests

[Create a custom rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/create-dashboard/) that blocks requests where Cloudflare detected personally identifiable information (PII) in the incoming request (as part of an LLM prompt), returning a custom JSON body:

* **When incoming requests match**:  
| Field            | Operator | Value |  
| ---------------- | -------- | ----- |  
| LLM PII Detected | equals   | True  |  
If you use the Expression Editor, enter the following expression:  
`(cf.llm.prompt.pii_detected)`
* **Rule action**: Block
* **With response type**: Custom JSON
* **Response body**: `{ "error": "Your request was blocked. Please rephrase your request." }`

For additional examples, refer to [Example mitigation rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/ai-security-for-apps/example-rules/). For a list of fields provided by AI Security for Apps, refer to [AI Security for Apps fields](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/ai-security-for-apps/fields/).

Combine with other Rules language fields

You can combine the previous expression with other [fields](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/) and [functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/) of the Rules language. This allows you to customize the rule scope or combine AI Security for Apps with other security features. For example:

* The following expression will match requests with PII in an LLM prompt addressed to a specific host:  
| Field            | Operator | Value       | Logic |  
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------- | ----- |  
| LLM PII Detected | equals   | True        | And   |  
| Hostname         | equals   | example.com |       |  
Expression when using the editor:  
`(cf.llm.prompt.pii_detected and http.host == "example.com")`
* The following expression will match requests coming from bots that include PII in an LLM prompt:  
| Field            | Operator  | Value | Logic |  
| ---------------- | --------- | ----- | ----- |  
| LLM PII Detected | equals    | True  | And   |  
| Bot Score        | less than | 10    |       |  
Expression when using the editor:  
`(cf.llm.prompt.pii_detected and cf.bot_management.score lt 10)`
