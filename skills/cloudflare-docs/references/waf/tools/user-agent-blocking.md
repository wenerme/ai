# User Agent Blocking

User Agent Blocking allows you to block specific browser or web application [User-Agent request headers ↗](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/User-Agent). User agent rules apply to the entire domain instead of individual subdomains.

User agent rules are applied after [zone lockdown rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/zone-lockdown/). If you allow an IP address via Zone Lockdown, it will skip any user agent rules.

Note

Cloudflare recommends that you use [custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/) instead of user agent rules to block specific user agents.

For example, a custom rule equivalent to the user agent [example rule](#create-a-user-agent-blocking-rule) provided in this page could have the following configuration:

* **Expression**: `http.user_agent eq "BadBot/1.0.2 (+http://bad.bot)"`
* **Action**: (a block or challenge action)

## Availability

Cloudflare User Agent Blocking is available on all plans. However, this feature is only available in the [new security dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security/) if you have configured at least one user agent rule.

The number of available user agent rules depends on your Cloudflare plan.

| Free            | Pro | Business | Enterprise |       |
| --------------- | --- | -------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Availability    | Yes | Yes      | Yes        | Yes   |
| Number of rules | 10  | 50       | 250        | 1,000 |
