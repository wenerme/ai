# Configure a rule with the Skip action

Use the _Skip_ action in a custom rule to skip one or more security features. A rule configured with the _Skip_ action is also known as a skip rule.

Skip rules allow specific requests to bypass security features that would otherwise block or challenge them. Use skip rules when legitimate traffic matches a security rule unintentionally. For example, to allow a trusted API client through [rate limiting rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/), or to exempt an internal monitoring service from [Managed Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/).

You can skip [rate limiting rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/), [Managed Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/), [Super Bot Fight Mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/super-bot-fight-mode/) rules, and several other security products. However, you cannot skip [Bot Fight Mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/bot-fight-mode/) (available on the Free plan).

For more information on the available options, refer to [Available skip options](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/skip/options/).
