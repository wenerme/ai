## Configure a custom response for blocked requests

Note

This feature is only available on Pro plans and above.

When you select the _Block_ action in a rule you can optionally define a custom response.

The custom response has three settings:

* **With response type**: Choose a content type or the default WAF block response from the list. The available custom response types are the following:  
| Dashboard value | API value          |  
| --------------- | ------------------ |  
| Custom HTML     | "text/html"        |  
| Custom Text     | "text/plain"       |  
| Custom JSON     | "application/json" |  
| Custom XML      | "text/xml"         |
* **With response code**: Choose an HTTP status code for the response, in the range 400-499\. The default response code is 403.
* **Response body**: The body of the response. Configure a valid body according to the response type you selected. The maximum field size is 2 KB.
