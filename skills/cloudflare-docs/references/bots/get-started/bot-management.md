# Bot Management

Bot Management for Enterprise is a paid add-on that provides sophisticated bot protection for your domain. Customers can identify automated traffic, take appropriate action, and view detailed analytics within the dashboard.

This Enterprise product provides the most flexibility to customers by:

* Generating a [bot score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/) of 1-99 for every request. Scores below 30 are commonly associated with bot traffic.
* Allowing customers to take action on this score with [WAF custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/) or [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/#incomingrequestcfproperties).
* Allowing customers to view this score in Bot Analytics or Logs.

## Setup

Cloudflare recommends that you deploy the following basic settings and customize them according to the traffic in your zone.

### Enable the latest Machine Learning version

Cloudflare encourages Enterprise customers to enable auto-updates to its Machine Learning models to get the newest bot detection models as they are released.

To enable auto-updates:

* [  New dashboard ](#tab-panel-3530)
* [ Old dashboard ](#tab-panel-3531)

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Security Settings** page.  
[ Go to **Settings** ](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings)
2. Filter by **Bot traffic**.
3. Go to **Bot Management**.
4. Under **Configurations**, select the edit icon for **Auto-updates to the Machine Learning Model** and turn it on.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** \> **Bots**.
3. Select **Configure Bot Management**.
4. Enable **Auto-updates to the Machine Learning Model**.

### Block AI Bots

Refer to [Block AI bots](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/additional-configurations/block-ai-bots/).

Note

You can view blocked AI bot traffic via [Security Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/).

### Deploy custom rule templates

The **Security Settings** toggles you configured above already provide baseline protection against definitely automated and likely automated traffic.

If you need additional control, such as path-specific protection, custom score thresholds, or combining bot score with other fields, Cloudflare provides [rule templates ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/security-rules?template=bot%5Ftraffic) to get started.

Note

Custom rules created from these templates execute before the managed rules configured in **Security Settings**. For more details on this execution order, refer to [Security features interoperability](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/feature-interoperability/).

* [Definite Bots template ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone:/security/security-rules/custom-rules/create?template=Definitely%20Bots): Targets malicious bot traffic while ignoring verified bots and routes delivering static content.  
```  
(cf.bot_management.score eq 1 and not cf.bot_management.verified_bot and not cf.bot_management.static_resource)  
```
* [Likely Bots template ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/security-rules/custom-rules/create?template=Likely%20Bots): Targets traffic likely to be malicious bots while ignoring verified bots and routes with static content. It may contain a small amount of non-bot traffic.  
```  
(cf.bot_management.score ge 2 and cf.bot_management.score le 29 and not cf.bot_management.verified_bot and not cf.bot_management.static_resource)  
```
* (Optional) [JavaScript detections template ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/security-rules/custom-rules/create?template=JavaScript%20Verified%20URLs): You must first enable JavaScript Detections from Security Settings, then set up a [managed challenge](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-challenges/challenge-types/challenge-pages/#managed-challenge). Make sure to add a method and URI path. JavaScript detections improves security for URLs that should only expect JavaScript-enabled clients.  
```  
(not cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed and http.request.method eq "" and http.request.uri.path in {""})  
```

```json
