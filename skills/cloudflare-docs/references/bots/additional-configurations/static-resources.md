# Static resource protection

Pro, Business, and Enterprise customers can use Cloudflare's bot solutions to protect their static resources from bots.

Warning

If you enable static resource protection, you may block good bots — like mail clients — that routinely fetch static resources. Make sure you understand your existing infrastructure before enabling this feature.

## Super Bot Fight Mode

To enable this feature as a Pro or Business customer or an Enterprise customer without Bot Management:

* [  New dashboard ](#tab-panel-5523)
* [ Old dashboard ](#tab-panel-5524)

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Security Settings** page.  
[ Go to **Settings** ](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings)
2. Filter by **Bot traffic**.
3. Go to **Super Bot Fight Mode**.
4. Under **Configurations**, select the edit icon for **Static resource protection** and turn it on.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** \> **Bots**.
3. Select **Configure Super Bot Fight Mode**.
4. For **Static resource protection**, select **On**.

Warning

The **Static Resource Protection** setting will only activate if at least one of the bot categories (definite, likely, or verified) is _not_ set to `Allow`. If all categories are set to `Allow`, this setting will not have any impact since it works alongside these bot settings as part of the managed rules.

## Bot Management for Enterprise

Static resources are protected by default when you create [custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/) using `cf.bot_management.score`.

To exclude static resources, you would need to include `not (cf.bot_management.static_resource)` as part of your custom rule.

## Which files are protected?

Static resources are files with the following extensions:

`ico|jpg|png|jpeg|gif|css|js|tif|tiff|bmp|pict|webp|svg|svgz|class|jar|txt|csv|doc|docx|xls|xlsx|pdf|ps|pls|ppt|pptx|ttf|otf|woff|woff2|eot|eps|ejs|swf|torrent|midi|mid|m3u8|m4a|mp3|ogg|ts`

Additionally, the `/.well-known/` URL path and all elements in it are considered a static resource, regardless of the file extension.

```json
{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BreadcrumbList","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"item":{"@id":"/directory/","name":"Directory"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"item":{"@id":"/bots/","name":"Bots"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"item":{"@id":"/bots/additional-configurations/","name":"Additional configurations"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":4,"item":{"@id":"/bots/additional-configurations/static-resources/","name":"Static resource protection"}}]}
```
