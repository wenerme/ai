# Machine Learning models

## Enable auto-updates to the Machine Learning models

Cloudflare encourages Enterprise customers to enable auto-updates to its Machine Learning models to get the newest bot detection models as they are released.

To enable auto-updates:

* [  New dashboard ](#tab-panel-4805)
* [ Old dashboard ](#tab-panel-4806)

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Security Settings** page.  
[ Go to **Settings** ](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings)
2. Filter by **Bot traffic**.
3. Go to **Bot Management**.
4. Under **Configurations**, select the edit icon for **Auto-updates to the Machine Learning Model** and turn it on.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** \> **Bots**.
3. Select **Configure Bot Management**.
4. Enable **Auto-updates to the Machine Learning Model**.

### What will change

If you are on an older Machine Learning model, you will see a score change to requests scored by the **Machine Learning** source instantly. If you are already on the latest model, you will see changes only after a new Machine Learning model becomes the global default.

Customers will be notified via email and dashboard prior to a new Machine Learning model becoming the global default.

### Risks of not updating

By not updating to the latest version, you will be using a Machine Learning model no longer maintained or monitored by our engineering team. As Internet traffic changes and new trends evolve, scoring accuracy by older versions may degrade.

### Model versions and release notes
