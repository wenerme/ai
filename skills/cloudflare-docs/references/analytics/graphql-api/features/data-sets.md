# Datasets (tables)

Cloudflare Analytics offers a range of datasets, including both general and product-specific ones. Datasets use a consistent naming scheme that explicitly identifies the type of data they return:

* **Domain** \- Each dataset is named after the field it describes and is associated with a set of nodes. Product-specific data nodes incorporate the name of the relevant product, for instance `loadBalancingRequests*` nodes.
* **Adaptive Sampling** \- Nodes that represent data acquired using adaptive sampling incorporate the `Adaptive` suffix. For more details, refer to [sampling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/sampling/).
* **Aggregated data** \- Nodes that represent aggregated data include the `Groups` suffix. For example, the `loadBalancingRequestsAdaptiveGroups` node represents aggregated data for Load Balancing requests. Aggregated data is returned in an array of `...Group` objects. Please note: we have a node that currently excluded from that naming convention - `workersInvocationsAdaptive`(beta).
* **Raw data** \- Raw data nodes, such as `loadBalancingRequestsAdaptive`, are not aggregated and so do not incorporate the `Groups` suffix. Raw data is returned in arrays containing objects of the relevant data type. For example, a query to `loadBalancingRequestsAdaptive` returns a variety of `LoadBalancingRequest` objects.

To find out more information about datasets, availability, beta, and deprecation statuses, please refer to GraphQL [discovery](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/features/discovery/) features.

## Working with datasets

### Aggregated fields

This example illustrates the structure for Groups:

```
type WhateverGroup {    count # No subfields, it is just the group size. Not available for roll-up tables.    sum {        # fields that support summing (numbers, maps of numbers)    }    avg {        # fields that support averaging (numbers)    }    uniq {        # fields that support uniqueing (numbers, strings, enums, IPs, dates, etc.)    }}
```

Unique values are not available as a dimension but can be queried as demonstrated in this example:

```
{  # Get number of bytes and unique IPs in each minute.  httpRequests1mGroups {    sum {      bytes    }    uniq {      uniques # unique IPs    }    dimensions {      datetimeMinute    }  }
  # Count the number of events in each hour.  firewallEventsAdaptiveGroups {    count    dimensions {      datetimeHour    }  }}
```

### Schema type definitions

Every exposed table has a GraphQL type definition. Type definitions observe the following rules:

* Regular fields represent themselves.
* Every field, including nested fields, has a type and represents a list of that type.
* The `enum` type represents an enumerated field.

Here is an example type definition for `ContentTypeMapElem`:

```
type ContentTypeMapElem {    edgeResponseContentType: UInt32!    requests: UInt64!    bytes: UInt64!}
# An array of httpRequestsGroup is the result of httpRequests1hGroups or# httpRequests1mGroups query.type httpRequestsGroup {    date: Date!    timeslot: DateTime!    requests: UInt64!    contentTypeMap: [ContentTypeMapElem!]!    # ... other fields}
enum TrustedClientCategory {    UNKNOWN    REAL_BROWSER    HONEST_BOT}
# An array of Request is the result of httpRequests query.type Request {    trustedClientCategory: TrustedClientCategory!    # ... other fields}
```
