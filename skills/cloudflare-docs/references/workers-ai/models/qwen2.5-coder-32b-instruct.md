OpenAI compatible endpoints 

Workers AI also supports OpenAI compatible API endpoints for `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/embeddings`. For more details, refer to [Configurations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/open-ai-compatibility/).

## Parameters

### Input

prompt

`string`requiredminLength: 1The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

lora

`string`Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

▶response\_format{}

`object`

raw

`boolean`default: falseIf true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

stream

`boolean`default: falseIf true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

max\_tokens

`integer`default: 256The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

temperature

`number`default: 0.6minimum: 0maximum: 5Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

top\_p

`number`minimum: 0maximum: 2Adjusts the creativity of the AI's responses by controlling how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

top\_k

`integer`minimum: 1maximum: 50Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.

seed

`integer`minimum: 1maximum: 9999999999Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

repetition\_penalty

`number`minimum: 0maximum: 2Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

frequency\_penalty

`number`minimum: 0maximum: 2Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.

presence\_penalty

`number`minimum: 0maximum: 2Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.

### Output

Synchronous — Send a request and receive a complete response 

response

`string`The generated text response from the model

▶usage{}

`object`Usage statistics for the inference request

▶tool\_calls\[\]

`array`An array of tool calls requests made during the response generation

Streaming — Send a request with \`stream: true\` and receive server-sent events 

type

`string`

format

`binary`
