# Observability

Agents emit structured events for every significant operation — RPC calls, state changes, schedule execution, workflow transitions, MCP connections, and more. These events are published to [diagnostics channels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/diagnostics-channel/) and are silent by default (zero overhead when nobody is listening).

## Event structure

Every event has these fields:

TypeScript

```

{

  type: "rpc",                        // what happened

  agent: "MyAgent",                   // which agent class emitted it

  name: "user-123",                   // which agent instance (Durable Object name)

  payload: { method: "getWeather" },  // details

  timestamp: 1758005142787            // when (ms since epoch)

}


```

`agent` and `name` identify the source agent — `agent` is the class name and `name` is the Durable Object instance name.

## Channels

Events are routed to eight named channels based on their type:

| Channel          | Event types                                                                                                                                      | Description                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| agents:state     | state:update                                                                                                                                     | State sync events                   |
| agents:rpc       | rpc, rpc:error                                                                                                                                   | RPC method calls and failures       |
| agents:message   | message:request, message:response, message:clear, message:cancel, message:error, tool:result, tool:approval                                      | Chat message and tool lifecycle     |
| agents:schedule  | schedule:create, schedule:execute, schedule:cancel, schedule:retry, schedule:error, queue:create, queue:retry, queue:error                       | Scheduled and queued task lifecycle |
| agents:lifecycle | connect, disconnect, destroy                                                                                                                     | Agent connection and teardown       |
| agents:workflow  | workflow:start, workflow:event, workflow:approved, workflow:rejected, workflow:terminated, workflow:paused, workflow:resumed, workflow:restarted | Workflow state transitions          |
| agents:mcp       | mcp:client:preconnect, mcp:client:connect, mcp:client:authorize, mcp:client:discover                                                             | MCP client operations               |
| agents:email     | email:receive, email:reply                                                                                                                       | Email processing                    |

## Subscribing to events

### Typed subscribe helper

The `subscribe()` function from `agents/observability` provides type-safe access to events on a specific channel:

* [  JavaScript ](#tab-panel-2506)
* [  TypeScript ](#tab-panel-2507)

JavaScript

```

import { subscribe } from "agents/observability";


const unsub = subscribe("rpc", (event) => {

  if (event.type === "rpc") {

    console.log(`RPC call: ${event.payload.method}`);

  }

  if (event.type === "rpc:error") {

    console.error(

      `RPC failed: ${event.payload.method} — ${event.payload.error}`,

    );

  }

});


// Clean up when done

unsub();


```

TypeScript

```

import { subscribe } from "agents/observability";


const unsub = subscribe("rpc", (event) => {

  if (event.type === "rpc") {

    console.log(`RPC call: ${event.payload.method}`);

  }

  if (event.type === "rpc:error") {

    console.error(

      `RPC failed: ${event.payload.method} — ${event.payload.error}`,

    );

  }

});


// Clean up when done

unsub();


```

The callback is fully typed — `event` is narrowed to only the event types that flow through that channel.

### Raw diagnostics\_channel

You can also subscribe directly using the Node.js API:

* [  JavaScript ](#tab-panel-2502)
* [  TypeScript ](#tab-panel-2503)

JavaScript

```

import { subscribe } from "node:diagnostics_channel";


subscribe("agents:schedule", (event) => {

  console.log(event);

});


```

TypeScript

```

import { subscribe } from "node:diagnostics_channel";


subscribe("agents:schedule", (event) => {

  console.log(event);

});


```

## Tail Workers (production)

In production, all diagnostics channel messages are automatically forwarded to [Tail Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/tail-workers/). No subscription code is needed in the agent itself — attach a Tail Worker and access events via `event.diagnosticsChannelEvents`:

* [  JavaScript ](#tab-panel-2508)
* [  TypeScript ](#tab-panel-2509)

JavaScript

```

export default {

  async tail(events) {

    for (const event of events) {

      for (const msg of event.diagnosticsChannelEvents) {

        // msg.channel is "agents:rpc", "agents:workflow", etc.

        // msg.message is the typed event payload

        console.log(msg.timestamp, msg.channel, msg.message);

      }

    }

  },

};


```

TypeScript

```

export default {

  async tail(events) {

    for (const event of events) {

      for (const msg of event.diagnosticsChannelEvents) {

        // msg.channel is "agents:rpc", "agents:workflow", etc.

        // msg.message is the typed event payload

        console.log(msg.timestamp, msg.channel, msg.message);

      }

    }

  },

};


```

This gives you structured, filterable observability in production with zero overhead in the agent hot path.

## Custom observability

You can override the default implementation by providing your own `Observability` interface:

* [  JavaScript ](#tab-panel-2510)
* [  TypeScript ](#tab-panel-2511)

JavaScript

```

import { Agent } from "agents";

const myObservability = {

  emit(event) {

    // Send to your logging service, filter events, etc.

    if (event.type === "rpc:error") {

      console.error(event.payload.method, event.payload.error);

    }

  },

};


class MyAgent extends Agent {

  observability = myObservability;

}


```

TypeScript

```

import { Agent } from "agents";

import type { Observability } from "agents/observability";


const myObservability: Observability = {

  emit(event) {

    // Send to your logging service, filter events, etc.

    if (event.type === "rpc:error") {

      console.error(event.payload.method, event.payload.error);

    }

  },

};


class MyAgent extends Agent {

  override observability = myObservability;

}


```

Set `observability` to `undefined` to disable all event emission:

* [  JavaScript ](#tab-panel-2504)
* [  TypeScript ](#tab-panel-2505)

JavaScript

```

import { Agent } from "agents";


class MyAgent extends Agent {

  observability = undefined;

}


```

TypeScript

```

import { Agent } from "agents";


class MyAgent extends Agent {

  override observability = undefined;

}


```
