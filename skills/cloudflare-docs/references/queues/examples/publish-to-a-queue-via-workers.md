# Publish to a Queue via Workers

**Last reviewed:**  9 months ago 

Publish to a Queue directly from your Worker.

The following example shows you how to publish messages to a Queue from a Worker. The example uses a Worker that receives a JSON payload from the request body and writes it as-is to the Queue, but in a real application you might have more logic before you queue a message.

## Prerequisites

* A [queue created](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/get-started/#3-create-a-queue) via the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com) or the [wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).
* A [configured **producer** binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/configure-queues/#producer-worker-configuration) in the Cloudflare dashboard or Wrangler file.

Configure your Wrangler file as follows:

* [  wrangler.jsonc ](#tab-panel-5692)
* [  wrangler.toml ](#tab-panel-5693)

JSONC

```

{

  "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",

  "name": "my-worker",

  "queues": {

    "producers": [

      {

        "queue": "my-queue",

        "binding": "YOUR_QUEUE"

      }

    ]

  }

}


```

Explain Code

TOML

```

"$schema" = "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json"

name = "my-worker"


[[queues.producers]]

queue = "my-queue"

binding = "YOUR_QUEUE"


```

### 1\. Create the Worker

The following Worker script:

1. Validates that the request body is valid JSON.
2. Publishes the payload to the queue.

TypeScript

```

interface Env {

  YOUR_QUEUE: Queue;

}


export default {

  async fetch(req, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {

    // Validate the payload is JSON

    // In a production application, we may more robustly validate the payload

    // against a schema using a library like 'zod'

    let messages;

    try {

      messages = await req.json();

    } catch {

      // Return a HTTP 400 (Bad Request) if the payload isn't JSON

      return Response.json({ error: "payload not valid JSON" }, { status: 400 });

    }


    // Publish to the Queue

    try {

      await env.YOUR_QUEUE.send(messages);

    } catch (e) {

      const message = e instanceof Error ? e.message : "Unknown error";

      console.error(`failed to send to the queue: ${message}`);

      // Return a HTTP 500 (Internal Error) if our publish operation fails

      return Response.json({ error: message }, { status: 500 });

    }


    // Return a HTTP 200 if the send succeeded!

    return Response.json({ success: true });

  },

} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;


```

Explain Code

To deploy this Worker:

Terminal window

```

npx wrangler deploy


```

### 2\. Send a test message

To make sure you successfully write a message to your queue, use `curl` on the command line:

Terminal window

```

# Make sure to replace the placeholder with your shared secret

curl -XPOST "https://YOUR_WORKER.YOUR_ACCOUNT.workers.dev" --data '{"messages": [{"msg":"hello world"}]}'


```

```

{"success":true}


```

This will issue a HTTP POST request, and if successful, return a HTTP 200 with a `success: true` response body.

* If you receive a HTTP 400, this is because you attempted to send malformed JSON to your queue.
* If you receive a HTTP 500, this is because the message was not written to your Queue successfully.

You can use [wrangler tail](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/real-time-logs/) to debug the output of `console.log`.
