# Pricing

Cloudflare Queues charges for the total number of operations against each of your queues during a given month.

* An operation is counted for each 64 KB of data that is written, read, or deleted.
* Messages larger than 64 KB are charged as if they were multiple messages: for example, a 65 KB message and a 127 KB message would both incur two operation charges when written, read, or deleted.
* A KB is defined as 1,000 bytes, and each message includes approximately 100 bytes of internal metadata.
* Operations are per message, not per batch. A batch of 10 messages (the default batch size), if processed, would incur 10x write, 10x read, and 10x delete operations: one for each message in the batch.
* There are no data transfer (egress) or throughput (bandwidth) charges.

| Workers Free        | Workers Paid                   |                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard operations | 10,000 operations/day included | 1,000,000 operations/month included + $0.40/million operations |
| Message retention   | 24 hours (non-configurable)    | 4 days default, configurable up to 14 days                     |

In most cases, it takes 3 operations to deliver a message: 1 write, 1 read, and 1 delete. Therefore, you can use the following formula to estimate your monthly bill:

```

((Number of Messages * 3) - 1,000,000) / 1,000,000  * $0.40


```

Additionally:

* Each retry incurs a read operation. A batch of 10 messages that is retried would incur 10 operations for each retry.
* Messages that reach the maximum retries and that are written to a [Dead Letter Queue](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/batching-retries/) incur a write operation for each 64 KB chunk. A message that was retried 3 times (the default), fails delivery on the fourth time and is written to a Dead Letter Queue would incur five (5) read operations.
* Messages that are written to a queue, but that reach the maximum persistence duration (or "expire") before they are read, incur only a write and delete operation per 64 KB chunk.

## Examples

If an application writes, reads and deletes (consumes) one million messages a day (in a 30 day month), and each message is less than 64 KB in size, the estimated bill for the month would be:

| Total Usage           | Free Usage           | Billed Usage | Price      |        |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Standard operations   | 3 \* 30 \* 1,000,000 | 1,000,000    | 89,000,000 | $35.60 |
| (write, read, delete) |                      |              |            |        |
| **TOTAL**             | **$35.60**           |              |            |        |

An application that writes, reads and deletes (consumes) 100 million \~127 KB messages (each message counts as two 64 KB chunks) per month would have an estimated bill resembling the following:

| Total Usage                  | Free Usage                 | Billed Usage | Price       |         |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------- |
| Standard operations          | 2 \* 3 \* 100 \* 1,000,000 | 1,000,000    | 599,000,000 | $239.60 |
| (2x ops for > 64KB messages) |                            |              |             |         |
| **TOTAL**                    | **$239.60**                |              |             |         |
