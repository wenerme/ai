# Containers (Beta)

Enhance your Workers with serverless containers

 Available on Workers Paid plan 

Run code written in any programming language, built for any runtime, as part of apps built on [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers).

Deploy your container image to Region:Earth without worrying about managing infrastructure - just define your Worker and [wrangler deploy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/general/#deploy).

With Containers you can run:

* Resource-intensive applications that require CPU cores running in parallel, large amounts of memory or disk space
* Applications and libraries that require a full filesystem, specific runtime, or Linux-like environment
* Existing applications and tools that have been distributed as container images

Container instances are spun up on-demand and controlled by code you write in your [Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers). Instead of chaining together API calls or writing Kubernetes operators, you just write JavaScript:

* [ Worker Code ](#tab-panel-3991)
* [ Worker Config ](#tab-panel-3992)

JavaScript

```

import { Container, getContainer } from "@cloudflare/containers";


export class MyContainer extends Container {

  defaultPort = 4000; // Port the container is listening on

  sleepAfter = "10m"; // Stop the instance if requests not sent for 10 minutes

}


export default {

  async fetch(request, env) {

    const { "session-id": sessionId } = await request.json();

    // Get the container instance for the given session ID

    const containerInstance = getContainer(env.MY_CONTAINER, sessionId);

    // Pass the request to the container instance on its default port

    return containerInstance.fetch(request);

  },

};


```

* [  wrangler.jsonc ](#tab-panel-3989)
* [  wrangler.toml ](#tab-panel-3990)

```

## Next Steps

### Deploy your first Container

Build and push an image, call a Container from a Worker, and understand scaling and routing.

[ Deploy a Container ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/get-started/) 

### Container Examples

See examples of how to use a Container with a Worker, including stateless and stateful routing, regional placement, Workflow and Queue integrations, AI-generated code execution, and short-lived workloads.
