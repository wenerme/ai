# Python Workflows SDK

Workflow entrypoints can be declared using Python. To achieve this, you can export a `WorkflowEntrypoint` that runs on the Cloudflare Workers platform. Refer to [Python Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python) for more information about Python on the Workers runtime.

Python Workflows are in beta, as well as the underlying platform.

Join the #python-workers channel in the [Cloudflare Developers Discord ↗](https://discord.cloudflare.com/) and let us know what you'd like to see next.

## Get Started

The main entrypoint for a Python workflow is the [WorkflowEntrypoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflowentrypoint) class. Your workflow logic should exist inside the [run](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#run) handler.

Python

```

from workers import WorkflowEntrypoint


class MyWorkflow(WorkflowEntrypoint):

    async def run(self, event, step):

        # steps here


```

For example, a Workflow may be defined as:

Python

```

from workers import Response, WorkflowEntrypoint, WorkerEntrypoint


class PythonWorkflowStarter(WorkflowEntrypoint):

    async def run(self, event, step):


        @step.do('step1')

        async def step_1():

            # does stuff

            print('executing step1')


        @step.do('step2')

        async def step_2():

            # does stuff

            print('executing step2')


        await step_1()

        await step_2()


class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):

    async def fetch(self, request):

        await self.env.MY_WORKFLOW.create()

        return Response("Hello world!")


```

You must add both `python_workflows` and `python_workers` compatibility flags to your Wrangler configuration file.

* [  wrangler.jsonc ](#tab-panel-10491)
* [  wrangler.toml ](#tab-panel-10492)

JSONC

```

TOML

[[workflows]]

name = "workflows-demo"

binding = "MY_WORKFLOW"

class_name = "PythonWorkflowStarter"


```

To run a Python Workflow locally, use [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), the CLI for Cloudflare Workers:

Terminal window

```

npx wrangler@latest dev


```

To deploy a Python Workflow to Cloudflare, run [wrangler deploy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/general/#deploy):

Terminal window

```

npx wrangler@latest deploy


```
