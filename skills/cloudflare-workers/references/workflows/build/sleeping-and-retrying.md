# Sleeping and retrying

This guide details how to sleep a Workflow and/or configure retries for a Workflow step.

## Sleep a Workflow

You can set a Workflow to sleep as an explicit step, which can be useful when you want a Workflow to wait, schedule work ahead, or pause until an input or other external state is ready.

Note

A Workflow instance that is resuming from sleep will take priority over newly scheduled (queued) instances. This helps ensure that older Workflow instances can run to completion and are not blocked by newer instances.

### Sleep for a relative period

Use `step.sleep` to have a Workflow sleep for a relative period of time:

TypeScript

```
await step.sleep("sleep for a bit", "1 hour");
```

The second argument to `step.sleep` accepts both `number` (milliseconds) or a human-readable format, such as "1 minute" or "26 hours". The accepted units for `step.sleep` when used this way are as follows:

TypeScript

```
| "second"| "minute"| "hour"| "day"| "week"| "month"| "year"
```

### Sleep until a fixed date

Use `step.sleepUntil` to have a Workflow sleep to a specific `Date`: this can be useful when you have a timestamp from another system or want to "schedule" work to occur at a specific time (e.g. Sunday, 9AM UTC).

TypeScript

```
// sleepUntil accepts a Date object as its second argumentconst workflowsLaunchDate = Date.parse("24 Oct 2024 13:00:00 UTC");await step.sleepUntil("sleep until X times out", workflowsLaunchDate);
```

You can also provide a UNIX timestamp (milliseconds since the UNIX epoch) directly to `sleepUntil`.

## Retry steps

Each call to `step.do` in a Workflow accepts an optional `StepConfig`, which allows you define the retry behaviour for that step.

If you do not provide your own retry configuration, Workflows applies the following defaults:

TypeScript

```
const defaultConfig: WorkflowStepConfig = {  retries: {    limit: 5,    delay: 10000,    backoff: "exponential",  },  timeout: "10 minutes",};
```

When providing your own `StepConfig`, you can configure:

* The total number of attempts to make for a step (limited to 10,000 retries per step)
* The delay between attempts (accepts both `number` (ms) or a human-readable format)
* What backoff algorithm to apply between each attempt: any of `constant`, `linear`, or `exponential`
* When to timeout (in duration) before considering the step as failed (including during a retry attempt, as the timeout is set per attempt)

For example, to limit a step to 10 retries and have it apply an exponential delay (starting at 10 seconds) between each attempt, you would pass the following configuration as an optional object to `step.do`:

TypeScript

```
let someState = await step.do(  "call an API",  {    retries: {      limit: 10, // The total number of attempts      delay: "10 seconds", // Delay between each retry      backoff: "exponential", // Any of "constant" | "linear" | "exponential";    },    timeout: "30 minutes",  },  async () => {    /* Step code goes here */  },);
```

## Force a Workflow instance to fail

You can also force a Workflow instance to fail and _not_ retry by throwing a `NonRetryableError` from within the step.

This can be useful when you detect a terminal (permanent) error from an upstream system (such as an authentication failure) or other errors where retrying would not help.

TypeScript

```
// Import the NonRetryableError definitionimport {  WorkflowEntrypoint,  WorkflowStep,  WorkflowEvent,} from "cloudflare:workers";import { NonRetryableError } from "cloudflare:workflows";
// In your step code:export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint<Env, Params> {  async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {    await step.do("some step", async () => {      if (!event.payload.data) {        throw new NonRetryableError(          "event.payload.data did not contain the expected payload",        );      }    });  }}
```

The Workflow instance itself will fail immediately, no further steps will be invoked, and the Workflow will not be retried.

If earlier steps registered rollback handlers, those handlers will still run before the instance settles into its terminal state.

## Register rollback handlers

You can attach a rollback handler to `step.do()` to implement saga-style compensation. When the Workflow later fails, Workflows runs registered rollback handlers in reverse `step-start` order.

A failed step with rollback options can also participate in rollback alongside any completed steps which have a rollback handler registered. For example, if a steps throws a `NonRetryableError` after registering rollback, its rollback handler runs with `output` set to `undefined`.

JavaScript

```
import { WorkflowEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";import { NonRetryableError } from "cloudflare:workflows";
export class OrderWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {  async run(_event, step) {    await step.do(      "reserve inventory",      async () => {        const reservation = await reserveInventory();        return { reservationId: reservation.id };      },      {        rollback: async ({ output }) => {          const { reservationId } = output;          await releaseInventory(reservationId);        },        rollbackConfig: {          retries: { limit: 3, delay: "10 seconds", backoff: "linear" },          timeout: "2 minutes",        },      },    );
    await step.do("charge card", async () => {      throw new NonRetryableError("payment processor rejected the charge");    });  }}
```

TypeScript

```
import {  WorkflowEntrypoint,  type WorkflowEvent,  type WorkflowStep,} from "cloudflare:workers";import { NonRetryableError } from "cloudflare:workflows";
export class OrderWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint<Env> {  async run(_event: WorkflowEvent<unknown>, step: WorkflowStep) {    await step.do(      "reserve inventory",      async () => {        const reservation = await reserveInventory();        return { reservationId: reservation.id };      },      {        rollback: async ({ output }) => {          const { reservationId } = output as { reservationId: string };          await releaseInventory(reservationId);        },        rollbackConfig: {          retries: { limit: 3, delay: "10 seconds", backoff: "linear" },          timeout: "2 minutes",        },      },    );
    await step.do("charge card", async () => {      throw new NonRetryableError("payment processor rejected the charge");    });  }}
```

Rollback handlers receive:

* `error` \- the error that caused the Workflow to fail.
* `output` \- the value returned by the forward step, or `undefined` if the step failed before returning

You can use `rollbackConfig` to control retry behavior for the rollback handler. Throw a `NonRetryableError` from the rollback handler to stop retrying it immediately.

## Catch Workflow errors

Any uncaught exceptions that propagate to the top level, or any steps that reach their retry limit, will cause the Workflow to end execution in an `Errored` state.

If you want to avoid this, you can catch exceptions emitted by a `step`. This can be useful if you need to trigger clean-up tasks or have conditional logic that triggers additional steps.

To allow the Workflow to continue its execution, surround the intended steps that are allowed to fail with a `try...catch` block.

TypeScript

```
...await step.do('task', async () => {  // work to be done});
try {    await step.do('non-retryable-task', async () => {    // work not to be retried        throw new NonRetryableError('oh no');    });} catch (e) {    console.log(`Step failed: ${e.message}`);    await step.do('clean-up-task', async () => {      // Clean up code here    });}
// the Workflow will not fail and will continue its execution
await step.do('next-task', async() => {  // more work to be done});...
```
