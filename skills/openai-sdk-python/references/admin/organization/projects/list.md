## List projects

`admin.organization.projects.list(ProjectListParams**kwargs)  -> SyncConversationCursorPage[Project]`

**get** `/organization/projects`

Returns a list of projects.

### Parameters

- `after: Optional[str]`

  A cursor for use in pagination. `after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include after=obj_foo in order to fetch the next page of the list.

- `include_archived: Optional[bool]`

  If `true` returns all projects including those that have been `archived`. Archived projects are not included by default.

- `limit: Optional[int]`

  A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 20.

### Returns

- `class Project: …`

  Represents an individual project.

  - `id: str`

    The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints

  - `created_at: int`

    The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the project was created.

  - `object: Literal["organization.project"]`

    The object type, which is always `organization.project`

    - `"organization.project"`

  - `archived_at: Optional[int]`

    The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the project was archived or `null`.

  - `external_key_id: Optional[str]`

    The external key associated with the project.

  - `name: Optional[str]`

    The name of the project. This appears in reporting.

  - `status: Optional[str]`

    `active` or `archived`

import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    admin_api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY"),  # This is the default and can be omitted
)

page = page.data[0]
print(page.id)
