# Overview

> Installation To use the DuckDB C API, download the [`libduckdb` archive](https://duckdb.org/install/index.html?environment=c) for your platform.
>
> The latest stable version of the DuckDB C API is current release.

DuckDB implements a custom C API modeled somewhat following the SQLite C API. The API is contained in the `duckdb.h` header. Continue to [Startup & Shutdown](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/clients/c/connect.html) to get started, or check out the [Full API overview](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/clients/c/api.html).

We also provide a SQLite API wrapper which means that if your application is programmed against the SQLite C API, you can re-link to DuckDB and it should continue working. See the [`shell_helpers.cpp`](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/tree/main/tools/shell/shell_helpers.cpp) file in our source repository for more information.

## Installation

The DuckDB C API can be installed as part of the `libduckdb` packages. Please see the [installation page](https://duckdb.org/install/index.html?environment=c) for details.
