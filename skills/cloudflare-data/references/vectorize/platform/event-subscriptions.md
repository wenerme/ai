# Event subscriptions

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/platform/event-subscriptions/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

[Event subscriptions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/event-subscriptions/) allow you to receive messages when events occur across your Cloudflare account. Cloudflare products (e.g., [KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/), [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/), [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)) can publish structured events to a [queue](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/), which you can then consume with Workers or [HTTP pull consumers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/pull-consumers/) to build custom workflows, integrations, or logic.

For more information on [Event Subscriptions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/event-subscriptions/), refer to the [management guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/event-subscriptions/manage-event-subscriptions/).
