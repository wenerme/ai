Clone a GitLab repository or project.

## Synopsis

Clone a GitLab repository to your local machine. Specify the
repository by name, namespace/repo path, full URL, or project ID.

The command uses your configured protocol (SSH or HTTPS).

To pass Git clone flags, add them after `--`. For example:
`glab repo clone <repo> -- --branch <branch-name>`

When you clone a fork you own, the command adds an `upstream`
remote that points to the parent project.

```plaintext
glab repo clone [<repo> | -g <group>] [<dir>] [flags] [-- <gitflags>...]
```

## Examples

```console
# Clones repository into current directory
glab repo clone gitlab-org/cli
glab repo clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli

# Clones repository into 'mydirectory'
glab repo clone gitlab-org/cli mydirectory

# Clones repository 'glab' for current user
glab repo clone glab

# Finds the project by the ID provided and clones it
glab repo clone 4356677

# Clones a specific branch
glab repo clone gitlab-org/cli -- --branch development

# Clones with a shallow clone (depth 1)
glab repo clone gitlab-org/cli -- --depth 1

# Clones with multiple Git flags
glab repo clone gitlab-org/cli -- --branch main --single-branch --depth 1

# Clones all repos in a group
glab repo clone -g everyonecancontribute --paginate

# Clones all non-archived repos in a group
glab repo clone -g everyonecancontribute --archived=false --paginate

# Clones only active projects in a group
glab repo clone -g everyonecancontribute --active=true --paginate

# Clones from a GitLab Self-Managed or GitLab Dedicated instance
GITLAB_HOST=salsa.debian.org glab repo clone myrepo
```
