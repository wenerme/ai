Create a personal access token for a GitLab Agent for Kubernetes.

## Synopsis

The token has the `k8s_proxy` scope and is valid until the end of the current day.

You might receive an email from your GitLab instance that a new personal
access token has been created.

```plaintext
glab cluster agent get-token [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
# Get a token for agent 123
glab cluster agent get-token --agent 123
```

## Options

```plaintext
  -a, --agent int                        The numerical Agent ID to connect to.
  -c, --cache-mode string                Mode to use for caching the token. Allowed values: keyring-filesystem-fallback, force-keyring, force-filesystem, no (default "force-keyring")
      --check-revoked                    Check if a cached token is revoked. This requires an API call to GitLab which adds latency every time a cached token is accessed.
      --jq string                        Filter JSON output with a jq expression.
      --token-expiry-duration duration   Duration for how long the generated tokens should be valid for. Minimum is 1 day and the effective expiry is always at the end of the day, the time is ignored. (default 24h0m0s)
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help          Show help for this command.
  -R, --repo string   Select another repository. You can use either OWNER/REPO or GROUP/NAMESPACE/REPO. The full URL or Git URL is also accepted.
```
