Manage cached GitLab Agent tokens.

## Synopsis

Tokens created by `glab cluster agent get-token` are cached locally
in the system keyring and filesystem to avoid creating new tokens
for each kubectl operation.

The GitLab CLI caches agent tokens in two locations:

- Keyring: Uses the system keyring (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service).
- Filesystem: Stores tokens in the user's cache directory as encrypted files.

The cache improves performance by avoiding the need to create new tokens for each kubectl operation when using `glab cluster agent update-kubeconfig`.

Cached tokens are stored using a key format that includes:

- Base64-encoded GitLab instance URL
- Agent ID

This ensures tokens are properly isolated by GitLab instance and agent.
