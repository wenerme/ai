Download all artifacts from the most recent pipeline.

## Synopsis

Downloads all artifacts from the most recent successful pipeline.

`<refName>` is a branch name, tag, or merge request reference. For a branch
or tag, use the name directly. For a merge request pipeline, replace `<iid>`
with the merge request IID and use the format that matches the pipeline type:

- `refs/merge-requests/<iid>/head`: Pipeline on the latest commit of the source branch.
- `refs/merge-requests/<iid>/merge`: Pipeline on the merged result (pipelines for merged results).

```plaintext
glab job artifact <refName> <jobName> [flags]
```

## Aliases

```

```
