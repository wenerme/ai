Authenticate a package manager against the GitLab Artifact Registry. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Configure a package manager to authenticate against the GitLab Artifact
Registry, using a short-lived access token exchanged from your GitLab
session.

With `--docker`, glab is registered as a Docker credential helper
for the registry, and Docker exchanges a fresh token on every pull or
push, so `--duration` does not apply.

Use `--registry` only for a registry the Artifact Registry
actually backs. The credential helper prefers the artifact registry
token and falls back to `container_registry_domains` only
when that exchange fails, so a container registry listed here gets an
artifact registry token it rejects on every pull.

Docker runs that credential helper as its own subprocess, which reads
your credentials from the configuration file and ignores
`GITLAB_TOKEN`. This command verifies the login the same way, so
run `glab auth login` first if no token is stored for the host.

With `--maven`, the exchanged token is written into a
`<server>` block in `~/.m2/settings.xml`, keyed by
`--registry-alias`. The token is not refreshed automatically.
Pass a `--duration` that outlasts your build, and run the
command again before it elapses. The default is 15 minutes and the
maximum is 12 hours.
Unlike `--docker`, `--maven` does read
`GITLAB_TOKEN`. `glab` writes the token directly
into `settings.xml`, so Maven does not need to resolve
your credentials itself.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.

```plaintext
glab artifact-registry login [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
# Configure Docker to authenticate against a registry
glab artifact-registry login --docker --registry registry.example.com

# Configure Maven to authenticate against a registry for two hours
glab artifact-registry login --maven --registry https://ar.example.com --duration 2h

```

## Options

```plaintext
      --docker                  Configure Docker to authenticate against the registry. Writes to $DOCKER_CONFIG, or ~/.docker when it is unset.
      --duration duration       How long the exchanged token should remain valid. Ignored for --docker. (default 15m0s)
      --hostname string         GitLab hostname to request the token from. Defaults to the configured GitLab instance.
      --maven                   Configure Maven to authenticate against the registry. Writes to ~/.m2/settings.xml.
      --registry string         Registry to authenticate against. For --docker, a bare hostname; for --maven, typically a URL.
      --registry-alias string   Alias/ID to register the registry under (--maven only). Defaults to a name derived from --registry.
```
