Check your access to the GitLab Artifact Registry. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Exchange a GitLab credential for a short-lived Artifact Registry access
token, then print the token's issuer, subject, audience, and expiry so
you can confirm which identity and instance you are authenticated as. No
credentials are written to disk.

Prerequisites:

- A GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE) instance on GitLab 19.1 or later.
- Token exchange enabled on the instance (the
  `gate_token_exchange_endpoint` feature flag).

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
For more information, see
<https://docs.gitlab.com/policy/development_stages_support/>.
