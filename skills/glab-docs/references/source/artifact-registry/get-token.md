Get a short-lived access token for the GitLab Artifact Registry. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Exchange a GitLab credential for a short-lived access token scoped to the
GitLab Artifact Registry. The command prints the bare token to stdout,
so a shell can capture it directly, for example to feed `docker login`.

Prerequisites:

- A GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE) instance on GitLab 19.1 or later.
- Token exchange enabled on the instance (the
  `gate_token_exchange_endpoint` feature flag).

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
For more information, see
<https://docs.gitlab.com/policy/development_stages_support/>.
