Download a file from a project's package registry.

## Synopsis

Download a generic package file, identified by its package name, version,
and file name.

Use `--path` to choose where the file is saved. If it names a directory
(it ends with a separator or already exists as one), the file is saved
there under its original name. Otherwise it is saved as that exact path,
letting you rename the file. By default the file is saved in the current
directory under its original name.

By default, the downloaded file is verified against the checksum stored in
the registry. This requires extra API calls to look up the file's metadata.
Use `--no-verify` to skip verification. This can allow corrupted or
tampered files; use with caution.

If the target file already exists, the download fails. Use `--force` to
overwrite it.

By default, files are downloaded from the current project. Use `--repo`
to target another project.

```plaintext
glab packages download --name <package> --version <version> --filename <file> [flags]
```

## Aliases

```plaintext
dl
```

## Examples

```console
# Download a package file to the current directory
glab packages download --name my-package --version 1.0.0 --filename app.zip

# Download into a directory, keeping the original file name
glab packages download -n my-package --version 1.0.0 --filename app.zip --path ./downloads/

# Download to an exact path, renaming the file
glab packages download -n my-package --version 1.0.0 --filename app.zip --path ./downloads/renamed.zip

# Download without verifying the checksum
glab packages download -n my-package --version 1.0.0 --filename app.zip --no-verify

# Overwrite an existing file
glab packages download -n my-package --version 1.0.0 --filename app.zip --force

# Use the 'dl' alias and target another project
glab packages dl -n my-package --version 1.0.0 --filename app.zip -R owner/repo

```

## Options

```plaintext
      --filename string   Name of the file within the package to download.
      --force             Overwrite the target file if it already exists.
  -n, --name string       Name of the package.
      --no-verify         Do not verify the checksum of the downloaded file. Warning: when enabled, this setting allows the download of files that are corrupt or tampered with.
  -p, --path string       Directory to save the file in (keeps its original name) or a full file path to rename it. Defaults to the original name in the current directory.
      --version string    Version of the package.
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help          Show help for this command.
  -R, --repo string   Select another repository. You can use either OWNER/REPO or GROUP/NAMESPACE/REPO. The full URL or Git URL is also accepted.
