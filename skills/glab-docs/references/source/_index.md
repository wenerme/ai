GLab is an open source GitLab CLI tool. It brings GitLab to your terminal, next to where you are already working with `git` and your code, without switching between windows and browser tabs. While it's powerful for issues and merge requests, `glab` does even more:

- View, manage, and retry CI/CD pipelines directly from your CLI.
- Create changelogs.
- Create and manage releases.
- Ask GitLab Duo Chat (Classic) questions about Git.
- Manage GitLab agents for Kubernetes.

`glab` is available for repositories hosted on GitLab.com, GitLab Dedicated, and GitLab Self-Managed. It supports multiple authenticated GitLab instances, and automatically detects the authenticated hostname from the remotes available in your working Git directory.

[command example]

## Install the CLI

Installation instructions are available in the GLab
[`README`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/#installation).

## Authenticate with GitLab

GLab supports multiple authentication methods including OAuth and personal access tokens.
To get started, run `glab auth login` and follow the interactive setup.

For detailed authentication instructions, see
[Authenticate with GitLab](authentication.md).

## Pagination

Commands that return lists of items are paginated. Use `--page` and `--per-page` to
navigate results. These commands respect the pagination limits configured on your
GitLab instance.

## Environment variables

For every environment variable `glab` reads, see
[environment variables](configuration.md#environment-variables).

## Options

```plaintext
  -h, --help      Show help for this command.
  -v, --version   Show glab version information.
```

## Commands

For the list of top-level `glab` commands, see [Commands](commands.md).
