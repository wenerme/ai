Delete a label from a project.

## Synopsis

Delete a label from a project by name. The label is removed from
the project; it is not removed from issues, merge requests, or
epics that already use it.

By default, the label is deleted from the current repository. Use
`--repo` to target another project.

```plaintext
glab label delete <name> [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
# Delete a label from the current repository
glab label delete bug

# Delete a label from another project
glab label delete bug -R owner/repo

```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help          Show help for this command.
  -R, --repo string   Select another repository. You can use either OWNER/REPO or GROUP/NAMESPACE/REPO. The full URL or Git URL is also accepted.
```
