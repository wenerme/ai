Work with GitLab issues.

## Synopsis

Open issues, list and view them, and manage their lifecycle: assign,
label, comment, close, reopen, and more. Work with issue boards under
`issue board`.

Use `--repo` to target a project other than the current one.

## Examples

```console
glab issue list
glab issue create --label --confidential
glab issue view --web 123
glab issue note -m "closing because !123 was merged" <issue number>
```

## Options

```plaintext
  -R, --repo string   Select another repository. You can use either OWNER/REPO or GROUP/NAMESPACE/REPO. The full URL or Git URL is also accepted.
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help   Show help for this command.
```
