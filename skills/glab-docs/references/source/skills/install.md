Install glab's bundled agent skills. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Install bundled `SKILL.md` files to `.agents/skills/`, the
cross-agent standard defined by the Agent Skills specification. This works
with GitLab Duo Agent Platform, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and any
other compliant agent.

By default, only the core `glab` skill is installed. Pass a positional
`name` argument to install a specific bundled skill instead. Run
`glab skills list` to see what is available.

Install scope:

- By default, skills are installed for the current project, in `.agents/skills/`
  at the root of the current Git repository.
- Use `--global` to install skills for the current user, in
  `~/.agents/skills/`.
- Use `--path` to install skills to a custom directory. The path is resolved
  relative to the current working directory, not the repository root.

To overwrite an existing skill file, use `--force`.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
