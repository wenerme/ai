Summarize Dependency Firewall activity from the CI log. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Read `.gitlab/df/ci-log.json` and print blocked and flagged packages
recorded during a `glab dependency-firewall` run.

The log is read from the current working directory. Run this command from
the same directory as the `glab dependency-firewall` run that wrote the
log, otherwise no activity is reported.

| Exit code | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `0` | No blocked entries in the log (allow-only or warnings). |
| `1` | The log could not be read. |
| `3` | At least one entry in the log is blocked. |

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
