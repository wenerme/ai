Check a package against the GitLab Dependency Firewall. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Check a single package coordinate against the GitLab Dependency Firewall policy for the current project and report the outcome (allow, warning, blocked). No package manager binary is required.

Supported package URL (PURL) types are `npm`, `pypi`, `maven`, and `gem`. The PURL must include a version, for example `pkg:npm/left-pad@1.3.0`.

This command does not write to the CI log at `.gitlab/df/ci-log.json`, so `glab dependency-firewall ci-summary` does not include its result.

Exit codes:

| Exit code | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `0` | Allow or warning. |
| `1` | Misconfiguration or transport error. |
| `3` | Blocked. |

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
For more information, see
<https://docs.gitlab.com/policy/development_stages_support/>.
