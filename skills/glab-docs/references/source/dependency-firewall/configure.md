Configure Dependency Firewall registry URLs for a package manager.

## Synopsis

Write a package manager's resolve and deploy registry URLs to
`.gitlab/df/config.json`.

Supported package managers: `npm`.

The file is written relative to the current working directory, so run this
command from the directory you run the package manager in.

Only the flags you pass are updated; existing values and unknown keys are
preserved.

This feature is in beta and might not be ready for production use.
It might be unstable and breaking changes can occur outside of major releases.
For more information, see
<https://docs.gitlab.com/policy/development_stages_support/>.
