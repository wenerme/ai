Manage software attestations. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Manage software attestations for artifacts built in GitLab CI/CD pipelines.
An attestation is a signed statement about an artifact, such as a provenance
statement that records how the artifact was built.

Use this command to verify that an artifact was built by the expected
GitLab project and pipeline.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
