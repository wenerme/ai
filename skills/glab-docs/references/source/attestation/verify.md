Verify the provenance of a specific artifact or file. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Verify the provenance of an artifact built by a GitLab CI/CD pipeline.
This command checks the artifact's signed attestation against the expected
GitLab project and pipeline.

This command requires the cosign binary. To install it, see
[Cosign installation](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/).

This command works only on GitLab.com.
