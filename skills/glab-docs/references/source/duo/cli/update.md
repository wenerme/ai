Update the GitLab Duo CLI binary to the latest compatible version.

## Synopsis

Checks for a newer GitLab Duo CLI version and installs it. If the binary is not installed yet, `glab` downloads the latest compatible version.

Updates stay within the major version this version of `glab` supports. When a newer major version exists, update `glab` first.

Updates do not apply when you use a custom binary set with `GLAB_DUO_CLI_BINARY_PATH` or the `duo_cli_binary_path` configuration key.

`glab duo cli --update` does the same thing.

```plaintext
glab duo cli update [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
# Update the GitLab Duo CLI, or download it if not installed
glab duo cli update

# Skip the download prompt
glab duo cli update --yes
```

## Options

```plaintext
  -y, --yes   Skip the download prompt when the binary is not installed.
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help   Show help for this command.
```
