Run the GitLab Duo CLI.

## Synopsis

Run the GitLab Duo CLI.

Use the GitLab Duo CLI to bring the GitLab Duo Agent Platform to your terminal.
Ask GitLab Duo questions about your codebase and use it to autonomously perform actions
on your behalf.

When you use the GitLab Duo CLI in the GitLab CLI, `glab` handles
authentication for you automatically.
You only need to authenticate once.

Prerequisites:

- Use GitLab 19.2 or later.
- Run `glab auth login` to authenticate.
- Meet the [prerequisites for GitLab Duo Agent Platform](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/#prerequisites).
- For GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated on 19.2 or later, turn on [GitLab Duo CLI access](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_cli/#turn-gitlab-duo-cli-access-on-or-off). It is on by default.

Note: If you are on GitLab 18.11 to 19.1, you can use the GitLab Duo CLI by turning on [beta and experimental features](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/turn_on_off.md#turn-on-beta-and-experimental-features).

Configuration options:

- `duo_cli_auto_run`: Skip the run confirmation prompt.
- `duo_cli_auto_download`: Skip the download confirmation prompt.

All other arguments and flags are passed through to the GitLab Duo CLI binary.

For more information, see the [GitLab Duo CLI documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_cli/).
