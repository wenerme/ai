Run the GitLab Duo CLI.

## Synopsis

Run the GitLab Duo CLI (`duo`) through `glab`.

The GitLab Duo CLI brings the GitLab Duo Agent Platform to your terminal. Ask GitLab Duo questions about your codebase and use it to autonomously perform actions on your behalf.

The GitLab Duo CLI runs in two modes:

- Interactive (default): `glab duo cli` opens a session for multiple prompts, with build and plan modes.
- Headless: `glab duo cli run --goal "<prompt>"` runs a single prompt and exits. For use in runners, scripts, and automated workflows.

When you use the GitLab Duo CLI through `glab`, `glab` handles authentication for you. You authenticate only once.

Prerequisites:

- Use GitLab 19.2 or later.
- Run `glab auth login` to authenticate.
- Meet the [prerequisites for GitLab Duo Agent Platform](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/#prerequisites).
- Set a [default GitLab Duo namespace](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/profile/preferences/#namespace-resolution-in-your-local-environment), or run the command in a project that has GitLab Duo access.
- For GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated on 19.2 or later, turn on [GitLab Duo CLI access](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_cli/#turn-gitlab-duo-cli-access-on-or-off). It is on by default.

If you are on GitLab 18.11 to 19.1, you can use the GitLab Duo CLI by turning on [beta and experimental features](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/turn_on_off/#turn-on-beta-and-experimental-features).

Configuration options:

- `duo_cli_auto_run`: Skip the run confirmation prompt.
- `duo_cli_auto_download`: Skip the download confirmation prompt.

`glab` passes all other arguments and flags through to the GitLab Duo CLI binary. To see the GitLab Duo CLI commands and flags, run `glab duo cli help`.

For more information, see the [GitLab Duo CLI documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_cli/).
