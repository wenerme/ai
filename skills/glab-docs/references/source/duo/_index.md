Work with GitLab Duo.

## Synopsis

Use the GitLab Duo Agent Platform in your terminal. Ask GitLab Duo questions about your codebase and use it to autonomously perform actions on your behalf.

`glab duo cli` installs and runs the GitLab Duo CLI (`duo`) binary. `glab` handles authentication, so you sign in only once with `glab auth login`.

The GitLab Duo CLI requires GitLab 19.2 or later, or GitLab 18.11 to 19.1 with beta and experimental features turned on. For all prerequisites and usage, see `glab duo cli --help`.
