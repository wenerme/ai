Manage glab settings.

## Synopsis

Manage key/value strings.

Current respected settings:

- `api_host`: Configure host for API endpoint. Defaults to the host itself. Also accepted as: `gitlab_api_host`. Scoped per host; set it with `--host`. Environment variable: `GITLAB_API_HOST`.
- `api_protocol`: What protocol to use to access the API endpoint. Supported values: `http`, `https`. Scoped per host; set it with `--host`. Environment variable: `API_PROTOCOL`.
- `artifact_registry_domains`: The domains of associated Artifact Registries. These are used to configure the Docker credential helper. Only list a domain here if it is actually backed by GitLab Artifact Registry: the credential helper tries this key first, and a successful token exchange is used as-is, with no fallback to container_registry_domains. A container-registry domain listed here by mistake gets an artifact-registry token the registry rejects, and `docker pull` hard-fails. Scoped per host; set it with `--host`. Environment variable: `ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_DOMAINS`.
- `branch_prefix`: Prefix used by `glab stack` when naming generated branches. Defaults to the current user's username (from `os/user.Current`), falling back to `glab-stack` if unavailable. Environment variable: `BRANCH_PREFIX`.
- `browser`: What browser glab should run when opening links. This global config cannot be overridden by hostname. Environment variable: `BROWSER`.
- `ca_cert`: Path to a CA certificate (PEM) used to verify the GitLab server's TLS certificate. Useful for self-signed or private certificate authorities. Scoped per host; set it with `--host`. Environment variable: `CA_CERT`.
- `check_update`: Allow glab to automatically check for updates and notify you when there are new updates. Setting the environment variable to true also forces a check, bypassing the once-a-day interval. Environment variables, first one set wins: `GLAB_CHECK_UPDATE`, `CHECK_UPDATE`.
- `client_cert`: Path to a client certificate (PEM) used for mutual TLS authentication. Scoped per host; set it with `--host`. Environment variable: `CLIENT_CERT`.
- `client_id`: OAuth application client ID. Required when authenticating with OAuth against a self-managed GitLab instance. Scoped per host; set it with `--host`. Environment variable: `GITLAB_CLIENT_ID`.
- `client_key`: Path to the private key (PEM) that matches client_cert. Scoped per host; set it with `--host`. Environment variable: `CLIENT_KEY`.
- `container_registry_domains`: The domains of associated container registries. These are used to configure the Docker credential helper. Scoped per host; set it with `--host`. Environment variable: `CONTAINER_REGISTRY_DOMAINS`.
- `custom_headers`: Custom HTTP headers to add to all HTTP requests made by glab. Each header must use exactly one of value, valueFromEnv, or valueFromCommand. A command must print the complete header value on one line. glab runs it once for each process. Scoped per host; set it with `--host`.
- `debug`: Output more logging information, including underlying Git commands, expanded aliases, and DNS error details. Environment variable: `GLAB_DEBUG`.
- `display_hyperlinks`: Whether or not to display hyperlinks in terminal output. Defaults to true (enabled for TTYs). Set to false to disable. Force hyperlinks in non-TTY environments by setting FORCE_HYPERLINKS=1. Environment variable: `DISPLAY_HYPERLINKS`.
- `duo_cli_auto_download`: Automatically download Duo CLI binary without prompting (true/false). Environment variable: `DUO_CLI_AUTO_DOWNLOAD`.
- `duo_cli_auto_run`: Automatically run GitLab Duo CLI without prompting (true/false). Set to true to skip the confirmation prompt. Environment variable: `DUO_CLI_AUTO_RUN`.
- `editor`: What editor glab should run when creating issues, merge requests, etc. This global config cannot be overridden by hostname. Also accepted as: `visual`, `glab_editor`. Environment variables, first one set wins: `GLAB_EDITOR`, `VISUAL`, `EDITOR`.
- `git_protocol`: What protocol to use when performing Git operations. Supported values: `ssh`, `https`. Environment variable: `GIT_PROTOCOL`.
- `glab_pager`: Your desired pager command to use, such as `less -R`. Takes precedence over the PAGER environment variable. GLAB_PAGER takes precedence over both. Environment variable: `GLAB_PAGER`.
- `glamour_style`: Set your desired Markdown renderer style. Available options are [dark, light, notty]. To set a custom style, refer to <https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour#styles>. Environment variables, first one set wins: `GLAB_GLAMOUR_STYLE`, `GLAMOUR_STYLE`.
- `host`: Default GitLab hostname to use. Also accepted as: `gitlab_host`, `gitlab_uri`, `gl_host`. Environment variables, first one set wins: `GITLAB_HOST`, `GITLAB_URI`, `GL_HOST`.
- `job_token`: CI job token used for Job-Token authentication. Typically populated automatically from CI_JOB_TOKEN when CI auto-login is enabled. Scoped per host; set it with `--host`.
- `no_prompt`: Set to true (1) to disable prompts, or false (0) to enable them. Also accepted as: `prompt_disabled`. Environment variables, first one set wins: `GLAB_NO_PROMPT`, `NO_PROMPT`, `PROMPT_DISABLED`.
- `notify_skill_updates`: Show a notice when an installed agent skill (bundled or remote) has updates available. Environment variable: `GLAB_NOTIFY_SKILL_UPDATES`.
- `orbit_local_auto_download`: Automatically download Orbit local CLI binary without prompting (true/false). Environment variable: `ORBIT_LOCAL_AUTO_DOWNLOAD`.
- `orbit_local_auto_run`: Automatically run Orbit local CLI without prompting (true/false). Set to true to skip the confirmation prompt. Environment variable: `ORBIT_LOCAL_AUTO_RUN`.
- `proxy`: Custom proxy for this host. Overrides environment proxy settings when set. Scoped per host; set it with `--host`. Environment variable: `PROXY`.
- `remote_alias`: Name of the `git remote` that points at the GitLab repository. Used to resolve which remote to operate against when multiple are configured. Also accepted as: `git_remote_url_var`, `git_remote_alias`, `remote_nickname`, `git_remote_nickname`. Environment variables, first one set wins: `GIT_REMOTE_URL_VAR`, `GIT_REMOTE_ALIAS`, `REMOTE_ALIAS`, `REMOTE_NICKNAME`, `GIT_REMOTE_NICKNAME`.
- `show_whats_new`: Show a one-time post-upgrade banner pointing at `glab whatsnew` when a new version is detected. Environment variable: `GLAB_SHOW_WHATS_NEW`.
- `skip_tls_verify`: Skip TLS certificate verification when talking to this host (true/false). Empty is treated as false. Use only for development; do not enable in production. Scoped per host; set it with `--host`. Environment variable: `SKIP_TLS_VERIFY`.
- `ssh_host`: Alternate hostname for SSH Git operations (e.g., `ssh.example.com` or `git.example.com`). Use this when SSH uses a different hostname than HTTP/API operations. Only affects SSH cloning and Git operations. Also accepted as: `gitlab_ssh_host`. Scoped per host; set it with `--host`. Environment variable: `GITLAB_SSH_HOST`.
- `subfolder`: Subfolder where GitLab is installed (e.g., `gitlab` for <https://example.com/gitlab/>). Use this when GitLab is hosted at a subfolder rather than domain root. Supports nested paths (e.g., `apps/gitlab` for <https://example.com/apps/gitlab/>). Slashes are automatically trimmed, so `gitlab`, `/gitlab`, and `gitlab/` are equivalent. Only applies to HTTP/HTTPS operations (API and Git clone). Also accepted as: `gitlab_subfolder`. Scoped per host; set it with `--host`. Environment variable: `GITLAB_SUBFOLDER`.
- `telemetry`: Set to false (0) to disable sending usage data to your GitLab instance or true (1) to enable. See <https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/settings/usage_statistics/> for more information. Environment variable: `GLAB_SEND_TELEMETRY`.
- `token`: Your GitLab access token. To get one, read <https://docs.gitlab.com/user/profile/personal_access_tokens/>. Also accepted as: `gitlab_token`, `oauth_token`. Scoped per host; set it with `--host`. Environment variables, first one set wins: `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `OAUTH_TOKEN`.
- `use_keyring`: Store the host's credentials in the operating system's keyring (true/false). Set automatically by `glab auth login`, which defaults to `true` when a keyring backend is available. Empty is treated as false (plaintext file storage). Scoped per host; set it with `--host`. Environment variable: `USE_KEYRING`.
