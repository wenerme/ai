Print the location of the global configuration file.

## Synopsis

Print where `glab` reads and writes its global configuration. The location depends on the platform and whether a legacy configuration directory exists, so use this command instead of hard-coding a path.

The command prints the path even if the file does not exist yet, so it is safe to run before the first `glab auth login`.

Use `--dir` to print the parent directory. Grant write access to that directory rather than to `config.yml` alone, because `glab` writes a temporary file in that directory first and then replaces `config.yml` with it.

Repository-local settings live in the repository's `.git/glab-cli/config.yml` and this command does not report them.

If no user configuration file exists, `glab` falls back to a read-only system-wide one. This command always reports the user location.

```plaintext
glab config path [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
# Print the path to the global configuration file
glab config path

# Print the directory that holds the configuration file
glab config path --dir

# Open the configuration file in an editor
$EDITOR "$(glab config path)"
```

## Options

```plaintext
      --dir   Print the configuration directory instead of the configuration file.
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help   Show help for this command.
```
