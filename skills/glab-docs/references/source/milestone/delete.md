Delete a milestone from a project or group.

## Synopsis

Delete a milestone, identified by its numeric ID, from a project or
group. The milestone is removed; issues, merge requests, and epics
that referenced it are no longer associated with it.

By default, the milestone is deleted from the current project. Use
`--project` to target a different project, or `--group` to delete a
group-level milestone. `--project` and `--group` are mutually exclusive.

```plaintext
glab milestone delete <id> [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
# Delete a milestone from the current project
glab milestone delete 123

# Delete a milestone from a different project
glab milestone delete 123 --project owner/project

# Delete a group milestone
glab milestone delete 123 --group example-group

```

## Options

```plaintext
      --group string     The ID or URL-encoded path of the group.
      --project string   The ID or URL-encoded path of the project.
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help          Show help for this command.
  -R, --repo string   Select another repository. You can use either OWNER/REPO or GROUP/NAMESPACE/REPO. The full URL or Git URL is also accepted.
```
