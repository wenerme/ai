Get a milestone by ID in a project or group.

## Synopsis

Get information about a single milestone in a project or group,
identified by its numeric ID. Use `--output json` to format the result
as JSON for use with other tools.

By default, the milestone is looked up in the current project. Use
`--project` to target a different project, or `--group` to look up a
group-level milestone. `--project` and `--group` are mutually exclusive.

```plaintext
glab milestone get [<id>] [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
# Get a milestone from the current project
glab milestone get 123

# Get a milestone from a different project
glab milestone get 123 --project owner/project

# Get a group milestone
glab milestone get 123 --group example-group

# Get a milestone as JSON
glab milestone get 123 --output json

```

## Options

```plaintext
      --group string     The ID or URL-encoded path of the group.
      --jq string        Filter JSON output with a jq expression.
  -F, --output string    Format output as: text, json. (default "text")
      --project string   The ID or URL-encoded path of the project.
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help          Show help for this command.
  -R, --repo string   Select another repository. You can use either OWNER/REPO or GROUP/NAMESPACE/REPO. The full URL or Git URL is also accepted.
