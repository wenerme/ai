Delete a scope from a runner controller. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Deletes a scope from a runner controller. This is an administrator-only feature.

Use one of the following flags to specify the scope type:

- --instance: Remove an instance-level scope from the runner controller.
- --runner <id>: Remove a runner-level scope for a specific runner. Multiple IDs
  can be comma-separated or specified by repeating the flag.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
