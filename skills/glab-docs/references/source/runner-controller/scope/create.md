Create a scope for a runner controller. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Creates a scope for a runner controller. This is an administrator-only feature.

Use one of the following flags to specify the scope type:

- --instance: Add an instance-level scope, allowing the runner controller
  to evaluate jobs for all runners in the GitLab instance.
- --runner <id>: Add a runner-level scope, allowing the runner controller
  to evaluate jobs for a specific instance-level runner. Multiple IDs can
  be comma-separated or specified by repeating the flag.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
For more information, see
<https://docs.gitlab.com/policy/development_stages_support/>.
