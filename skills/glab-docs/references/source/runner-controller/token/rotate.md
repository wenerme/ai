Rotate a token for a runner controller. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Replaces the current token with a new one. Store the new token value
securely before closing the terminal. You cannot retrieve the token
again. Prompts for confirmation before rotation. Use `--force`
to skip the confirmation prompt in non-interactive contexts.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
