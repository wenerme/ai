Update the GitLab Orbit CLI binary to the latest version. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Checks for a newer GitLab Orbit CLI version and installs it. If the binary is not installed yet, `glab` downloads the latest version.

Updates do not apply when you use a custom binary set with `GLAB_ORBIT_CLI_BINARY_PATH` or the `orbit_cli_binary_path` configuration key.

`glab orbit --update` does the same thing.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
