Run the Orbit CLI. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Run the Orbit CLI through glab.

Every command and flag, including `--help`, is forwarded verbatim to the managed Orbit binary. glab downloads, verifies, and updates that binary for you on first use. Until the binary is installed, `--help` shows this text instead. glab passes your resolved GitLab credential to the binary on every invocation, so remote commands such as `glab orbit query` need no separate login.

glab handles only `--install`, `--update`, and `--yes` itself. Run `glab help orbit` to see them.

Prerequisites:

- Run `glab auth login` to authenticate.
- Orbit must be enabled for your namespace (the `knowledge_graph` feature flag).

Configuration options:

- `orbit_cli_auto_run`: Skip the run confirmation prompt.
- `orbit_cli_auto_download`: Skip the download confirmation prompt.

For more information, see the [Orbit documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/orbit/).

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.

glab orbit [<command>] [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
# Connect Orbit to the coding agents on this machine, or undo it
$ glab orbit setup
$ glab orbit uninstall

# Query the remote Orbit graph (authenticates automatically)
$ glab orbit status
$ glab orbit query ./query.json
$ glab orbit graph-status --full-path gitlab-org/gitlab

# Index and search a local copy of the code graph
$ glab orbit index .
$ glab orbit grep "parse config"

# Show the Orbit binary's own help and version
$ glab orbit --help
$ glab orbit version

# Install or update the managed binary without running it
$ glab orbit --install
$ glab orbit --update
```

## Options

```plaintext
  -h, --help      Show the Orbit binary's help, or this text until the binary is installed.
      --install   Install the Orbit binary without running it.
      --update    Check for and install updates to the binary.
  -y, --yes       Skip confirmation prompts.
```
