GitLab Knowledge Graph commands. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Run the Orbit CLI for the GitLab Knowledge Graph (product name: Orbit).

Every command and flag is forwarded verbatim to the managed Orbit binary, which is downloaded, verified, and kept up to date for you on first use. `glab orbit remote <command>` authenticates automatically using your resolved GitLab credential; all other commands run the binary with no extra environment.

Prerequisites:

- Run `glab auth login` to authenticate.
- Orbit must be enabled for your namespace (the `knowledge_graph` feature flag).

Configuration options:

- `orbit_local_auto_run`: Skip the run confirmation prompt.
- `orbit_local_auto_download`: Skip the download confirmation prompt.

For more information, see the [Orbit documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/orbit/).

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
For more information, see
<https://docs.gitlab.com/policy/development_stages_support/>.
