```console
# Interactively select a job to trace
glab ci trace

# Trace job with ID 224356863
glab ci trace 224356863

# Trace job with the name 'lint'
glab ci trace lint
```

## Options

```plaintext
  -b, --branch string     The branch to search for the job. (default current branch)
  -p, --pipeline-id int   The pipeline ID to search for the job.
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help          Show help for this command.
  -R, --repo string   Select another repository. You can use either OWNER/REPO or GROUP/NAMESPACE/REPO. The full URL or Git URL is also accepted.
```
