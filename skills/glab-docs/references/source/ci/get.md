Get the details of a CI/CD pipeline.

## Synopsis

Defaults to the current branch. Use `--pipeline-id` to specify a pipeline
instead of fetching the latest for a branch.

Use `--merge-request` to target the head pipeline of a specific merge
request by IID. This differs from `--branch` when the MR's head pipeline
diverges from the latest pipeline on its source branch — for example, forks or
detached pipelines.

Use `--status` to filter jobs by state (passed through to the API's
`scope` parameter).

Use `--output json` to get the pipeline details as JSON.
