Delete CI/CD pipelines.

## Synopsis

You can delete by ID, or filter by status, source, or age. Use `--dry-run` to preview
the pipelines that would be deleted.

```plaintext
glab ci delete <id> [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
glab ci delete 34
glab ci delete 12,34,2
glab ci delete --source=api
glab ci delete --status=failed
glab ci delete --older-than 24h
glab ci delete --older-than 24h --status=failed
```

## Options

```plaintext
      --dry-run               Simulate process, but do not delete anything.
      --older-than duration   Filter pipelines older than the given duration. Valid units: h, m, s, ms, us, ns.
      --page int              Page number.
      --paginate              Make additional HTTP requests to fetch all pages of projects before cloning. Respects '--per-page'.
      --per-page int          Number of items to list per page.
      --source string         Filter pipelines by source: api, chat, external, external_pull_request_event, merge_request_event, ondemand_dast_scan, ondemand_dast_validation, parent_pipeline, pipeline, push, schedule, security_orchestration_policy, trigger, web, webide.
  -s, --status string         Delete pipelines by status: running, pending, success, failed, canceled, skipped, created, manual.
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help          Show help for this command.
  -R, --repo string   Select another repository. You can use either OWNER/REPO or GROUP/NAMESPACE/REPO. The full URL or Git URL is also accepted.
