Cancel CI/CD pipelines.

## Synopsis

Cancels one or more running CI/CD pipelines by ID. You can pass
multiple pipeline IDs as separate arguments, in a comma-separated
list, or in a quoted space-separated list.

To preview which pipelines would be canceled without making changes,
use `--dry-run`.

```plaintext
glab ci cancel pipeline <id> [<id>...] [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
# Cancel a single pipeline
glab ci cancel pipeline 1504182795

# Cancel multiple pipelines, comma-separated
glab ci cancel pipeline 1504182795,1504182796

# Cancel multiple pipelines, space-separated in quotes
glab ci cancel pipeline "1504182795 1504182796"

# Preview which pipelines would be canceled
glab ci cancel pipeline 1504182795,1504182796 --dry-run

```

## Options

```plaintext
      --dry-run   Show which pipelines would be canceled, without canceling them.
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help          Show help for this command.
  -R, --repo string   Select another repository. You can use either OWNER/REPO or GROUP/NAMESPACE/REPO. The full URL or Git URL is also accepted.
