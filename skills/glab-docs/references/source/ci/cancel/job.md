Cancel CI/CD jobs.

## Synopsis

Cancels one or more running CI/CD jobs by ID. You can pass multiple
job IDs as separate arguments, in a comma-separated list, or in a
quoted space-separated list.

To preview which jobs would be canceled without making changes, use
`--dry-run`.

```plaintext
glab ci cancel job <id> [<id>...] [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
# Cancel a single job
glab ci cancel job 1504182795

# Cancel multiple jobs, comma-separated
glab ci cancel job 1504182795,1504182796

# Cancel multiple jobs, space-separated in quotes
glab ci cancel job "1504182795 1504182796"

# Preview which jobs would be canceled
glab ci cancel job 1504182795,1504182796 --dry-run

```

## Options

```plaintext
      --dry-run   Show which jobs would be canceled, without canceling them.
```
