View, run, retry, and cancel CI/CD pipeline jobs.

## Synopsis

Supports viewing, running, tracing, and canceling jobs.

Use arrow keys to navigate jobs and logs.

- `Enter` to toggle through a job's logs / traces, or display a child pipeline.
  Trigger jobs are marked with a `»`.
- `Esc` or `q` to close the logs or trace, or return to the parent pipeline.
- `Ctrl+R`, `Ctrl+P` to run, retry, or play a job. Use `Tab` or arrow keys to
  navigate the modal, and `Enter` to confirm.
- `Ctrl+D` to cancel a job. If the selected job isn't running or pending,
  quits the CI/CD view.
- `Ctrl+Q` to quit the CI/CD view.
- `Ctrl+Space` to suspend application and view the logs. Similar to `glab ci trace`.
- Supports `vi` style bindings and arrow keys for navigating jobs and logs.
