Sync agent session data to GitLab. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Read new entries from the local agent transcript since the last sync
and POST them to GitLab as audit events.

Called by the Stop hook after every agent turn. Also used by the
SessionEnd hook (with --complete) to mark the session as complete.

Project is resolved from the Git remote of the current directory, or overridden with -R/--repo.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
