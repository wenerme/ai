Diagnose AI agent governance configuration, authentication, and hook setup. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Check that AI agent governance is correctly configured on this machine.

Verifies:

- Authentication: glab is authenticated with a valid token
- glab in PATH: the binary is findable so hooks will work
- Claude Code hooks: Stop and SessionEnd hooks are installed
- API connectivity: can reach the GitLab API

Outputs a clear remediation command for any check that fails.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
