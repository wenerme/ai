Configure this machine to record AI agent sessions. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Configure the current machine for AI agent governance session capture.

Installs the following:

- Stop hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- SessionEnd hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`

The Stop and SessionEnd hooks are the sync mechanism. Safe to run multiple times — existing hooks are not duplicated. Run `glab govern doctor` afterwards to verify the setup.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
