Update a secure file in a project.

## Synopsis

Update a secure file in a project, identified by its name.
The command asks for confirmation before updating; use `-y` to skip
the prompt in scripts.

By default, the file is updated in the current project. Use `--repo`
to target another project.

If the file content is unchanged, no update is performed.

Updating a secure file changes its ID. When you download the file afterward, reference it by `--name` instead of `--id`.

```plaintext
glab securefile update <name> <path> [flags]
```

## Aliases

```plaintext
overwrite
```

## Examples

```console
# Update a secure file
glab securefile update "file.txt" securefiles/localfile.txt

# Skip the confirmation prompt
glab securefile update "file.txt" securefiles/localfile.txt -y

# Use the 'overwrite' alias
glab securefile overwrite "file.txt" securefiles/localfile.txt

```

## Options

```plaintext
  -y, --yes   Skip the confirmation prompt.
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help          Show help for this command.
  -R, --repo string   Select another repository. You can use either OWNER/REPO or GROUP/NAMESPACE/REPO. The full URL or Git URL is also accepted.
```
