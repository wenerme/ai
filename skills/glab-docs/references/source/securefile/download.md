Download one or more secure files from a project.

## Synopsis

To download a single file, identify it by its numeric ID (as a positional
argument or with `--id`) or by its name with `--name`. To download every
secure file in the project (up to a limit of 100), use `--all`.

Use `--path` to save a single download to a specific filename, or
`--output-dir` to choose the destination directory when downloading
multiple files.

By default, downloaded files are verified against their checksum.
Use `--no-verify` to skip verification, or `--force-download` to keep
files even when verification fails. Both options can allow corrupted
or tampered files; use with caution.

By default, files are downloaded from the current project. Use
`--repo` to target another project.

```plaintext
glab securefile download [<id>] [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
# Download a file by ID (positional or flag)
glab securefile download 1
glab securefile download --id 1

# Download a file by ID to a specific path
glab securefile download 1 --path "securefiles/file.txt"

# Download a file by name to the current directory
glab securefile download --name my-secure-file.pem

# Download a file by name to a chosen path
glab securefile download --name my-secure-file.pem --path securefiles/some-other-name.pem

# Download without verifying the checksum
glab securefile download 1 --no-verify

# Download all secure files in the project (up to 100)
glab securefile download --all

# Download all secure files to a specific directory
glab securefile download --all --output-dir secure_files/

```
