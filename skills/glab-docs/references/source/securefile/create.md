Upload a new secure file to a project.

## Synopsis

Provide the name to store the file under, followed by the local path
to the file to upload.

Secure files are stored outside the project's repository and not in
version control. Both plain text and binary files are supported, up
to a maximum size of 5 MB.

By default, the file is uploaded to the current project. Use `--repo`
to target another project.

```plaintext
glab securefile create <name> <path> [flags]
```

## Aliases

```plaintext
upload
```

## Examples

```console
# Upload a secure file from a local path
glab securefile create "newfile.txt" "securefiles/localfile.txt"

# Upload using the 'upload' alias
glab securefile upload "newfile.txt" "securefiles/localfile.txt"

# Upload to another project
glab securefile create "newfile.txt" "securefiles/localfile.txt" -R owner/repo

```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help          Show help for this command.
  -R, --repo string   Select another repository. You can use either OWNER/REPO or GROUP/NAMESPACE/REPO. The full URL or Git URL is also accepted.
