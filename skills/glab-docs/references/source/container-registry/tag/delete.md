Delete container registry tags.

## Synopsis

Delete one container registry tag by name, or delete matching tags in
bulk by filter.

Deleting a single tag is synchronous. Bulk deletion is scheduled
asynchronously by GitLab; matching tags may remain visible until the
background deletion job has completed.

To bulk delete tags, omit <tag-name> and provide at least one bulk
deletion flag: --name-regex-delete, --name-regex-keep, --keep-n, or
--older-than.

The repository ID must belong to the selected project. Use -R/--repo
to specify the owning project when running this command outside that
project's Git checkout.

```plaintext
glab container-registry tag delete <repository-id> [<tag-name>] [flags]
```

## Aliases

```plaintext
del
```

## Examples

```console
# Delete a container registry tag with a confirmation prompt
glab container-registry tag delete 123 latest

# Skip the confirmation prompt
glab container-registry tag delete 123 latest --yes

# Schedule tags matching a regular expression for deletion
glab container-registry tag delete 123 --name-regex-delete '^release-.*' --yes

# Schedule old tags for deletion, but keep the 10 most recent matching tags
glab container-registry tag delete 123 --name-regex-delete '.*' --keep-n 10 --older-than 30d --yes

# Delete a container registry tag in another project
glab container-registry tag delete 123 latest -R gitlab-org/cli
```
