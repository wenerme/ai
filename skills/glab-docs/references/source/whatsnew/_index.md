Show release notes for new versions of glab.

## Synopsis

With no arguments, shows release notes for every glab release
published since the last time you ran 'whatsnew' or saw the
post-upgrade banner — capped at the most recent 10 releases.

Pass a version argument to view notes for a specific release,
or use --since to set an explicit baseline.
