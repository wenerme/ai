Set an alias for a longer command.

## Synopsis

Declare a word as an alias for a longer command.

Use quotation marks when you define a command, as shown in the examples.

Your expansion can include arguments and flags. If your expansion
includes positional placeholders such as `$1` or `$2`, any extra
arguments that follow the invocation of the alias are inserted into
those placeholders.

To run an alias through `sh`, a shell converter, specify the
`--shell` flag. With shell conversion, you can compose commands
with `|` or redirect with `>`. Shell aliases have these caveats:

- Extra arguments that follow the alias are not passed to the expansion.
  To accept arguments, use `$1`, `$2`, and so on.
- To accept all arguments, use `$@`.

On Windows, shell aliases run through `sh` as installed by Git for
Windows. If you installed Git in another way on Windows, shell aliases
might not work.

```plaintext
glab alias set <alias name> '<command>' [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
# Define an alias for "mr view"
glab alias set mrv 'mr view'
# Run the alias; it expands to "glab mr view -w 123"
glab mrv -w 123

# Define an alias with a positional placeholder
glab alias set createissue 'glab create issue --title "$1"'
# Run the alias with an argument and an extra flag
glab createissue "My Issue" --description "Something is broken."

# Define a shell alias that pipes glab output to grep
glab alias set --shell igrep 'glab issue list --assignee="$1" | grep $2'
# Run the shell alias with two arguments
glab igrep user foo

```

## Options

```plaintext
  -s, --shell   Declare an alias to be passed through a shell interpreter.
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help   Show help for this command.
```
