Returns a single deploy key specified by the ID.

## Synopsis

Pass the ID of the key to return as an argument. Find key IDs by
running `glab deploy-key list --show-id`. Use `--repo` to target a
project other than the current one.

By default, the command prints the key's title, public key, push access,
and creation date. Use `--output json` to return the full key object.

## Options
