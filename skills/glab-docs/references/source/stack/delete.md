Delete a stack. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Delete a stacked diff.

Removes the stack's local metadata from the `.git/stacked` directory.
Use this command to clean up stacks for merged or abandoned merge requests.
Branches, commits, and merge requests are not affected.

When stack-name is omitted, choose from the list of all stacks.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
