Reorder a stack of diffs. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Opens an editor with one diff per line, so you can rearrange them.

When you save and close the file, each diff's branch is rebased onto the branch of the diff now before it, and each moved diff's merge request is retargeted to match. The rebased branches are not pushed automatically, so run `glab stack sync` to force-push them and replace the old commits on GitLab.

If a rebase hits a conflict, resolve it, run `git rebase --continue`, and then run `glab stack reorder --continue`. To restore the original order instead, run `glab stack reorder --abort`.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
