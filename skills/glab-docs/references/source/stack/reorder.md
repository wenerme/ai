Reorder a stack of diffs. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Change the order of diffs in the current stack.

You choose the new order in your editor. After you save and close the file, each branch is then rebased onto its new parent so the local Git history matches the new order, and each diff is retargeted onto the branch before it to reflect the new order. Nothing is pushed. GitLab shows the old commits until you run `glab stack sync` to force-push the rebased branches.

If a rebase hits a conflict, resolve it, finish the rebase with `git rebase --continue` and then run `glab stack reorder --continue`. Alternatively, run `glab stack reorder --abort` to restore the original branch order.
This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
