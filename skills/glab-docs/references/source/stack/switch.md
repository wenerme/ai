Switch between stacks. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

If you do not provide a stack name, the command shows a list of stacks for you to choose from.

After you switch, use `glab stack move` to check out a diff in the new stack.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
For more information, see
