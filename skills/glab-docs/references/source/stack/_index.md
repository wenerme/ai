Create, manage, and work with stacked diffs. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

A stack is a series of small, dependent merge requests that together deliver a feature. Reviewers can review and merge earlier changes while you keep building on top of them.

Locally, each diff in the stack is one commit on its own branch, built on the branch of the previous diff. When you run `glab stack sync`, each diff becomes a merge request that targets the branch of the previous diff. The first diff targets the base branch.

The `glab stack` commands act on the stack you last created or switched to, regardless of which branch you have checked out.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
