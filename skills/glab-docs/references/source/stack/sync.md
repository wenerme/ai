Sync and submit progress on a stacked diff. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Sync and submit progress on a stacked diff. This command runs these steps:

1. Optional. If working in a fork, select whether to push to the fork,
   or the upstream repository.
1. Optional. If --update-base is set, rebases the entire stack onto the
   latest version of the base branch.
1. Pushes any amended changes to their merge requests.
1. Rebases any changes that happened previously in the stack.
1. Creates merge requests for branches that don't have one yet,
   unless --skip-mr-creation is set.
1. Removes any branches that were already merged, or with a closed merge request.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
