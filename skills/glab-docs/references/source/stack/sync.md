Push the stack to GitLab, and create or update its merge requests. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Updates GitLab to match your local stack:

- Creates a merge request for each diff without one, unless `--skip-mr-creation` or `--skip-push` is set. Each merge request targets the branch of the previous diff, or the base branch for the first diff.
- Pulls changes made on GitLab, such as applied suggestions, into any diff whose branch is behind its remote.
- If you amended a diff since the last sync, rebases the diffs after it. Then, unless `--skip-push` is set, force-pushes the stack's branches.
- Removes diffs with merged merge requests and deletes their local branches. Keeps diffs with closed merge requests.
- If you're working in a fork, asks whether to push to the fork or the upstream repository.
- With `--update-base`, rebases the stack onto the latest version of the base branch. Then, unless `--skip-push` is set, force-pushes the stack's branches.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.

```plaintext
glab stack sync [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
glab stack sync
glab stack sync --no-verify
glab stack sync --update-base
glab stack sync --skip-push
glab stack sync --skip-mr-creation
glab stack sync --assignee user1,user2
glab stack sync --label bug,priority::high
glab stack sync --reviewer user1 --reviewer user2
```

## Options

```plaintext
  -a, --assignee usernames   Assign merge request to people by their usernames. Multiple usernames can be comma-separated or specified by repeating the flag.
  -l, --label name           Add label by name. Multiple labels can be comma-separated or specified by repeating the flag.
      --no-verify            Bypass the pre-push hook. (See githooks(5) for more information.)
      --reviewer usernames   Request review from users by their usernames. Multiple usernames can be comma-separated or specified by repeating the flag.
      --skip-mr-creation     Skip creating merge requests for branches that don't have one yet.
      --skip-push            Rebase the stack locally without pushing branches or creating merge requests. Still fetches from the remote and calls the GitLab API.
      --update-base          Rebase the stack onto the latest version of the base branch.
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help          Show help for this command.
