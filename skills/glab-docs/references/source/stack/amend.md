Save your changes to an existing diff. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Adds your changes to the diff you have checked out. Its merge request updates the next time you run `glab stack sync`, which also rebases the diffs after it.

To create a new diff from your changes instead, use `glab stack save`.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
For more information, see
