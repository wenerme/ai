Delete a pipeline schedule by ID.

## Synopsis

Delete a CI/CD pipeline schedule, identified by its numeric ID. The
schedule is removed from the project; pipelines previously triggered
by it are not affected.

By default, the schedule is deleted from the current project. Use
`--repo` to target another project.

```plaintext
glab schedule delete <id> [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
# Delete the schedule with ID 10
glab schedule delete 10

# Delete a schedule in another project
glab schedule delete 10 -R owner/repo

```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help          Show help for this command.
  -R, --repo string   Select another repository. You can use either OWNER/REPO or GROUP/NAMESPACE/REPO. The full URL or Git URL is also accepted.
```
