Generate a changelog for the current project.

## Synopsis

Generates a changelog from the commits in your project's Git
repository. If you do not pass `--version`, glab determines
the version by running `git describe` against your local tags.

By default, GitLab reads the changelog configuration from
`.gitlab/changelog_config.yml` in the project. To use a
different file, pass `--config-file`.

To limit the range of commits, use `--from` and `--to`.
glab excludes the `--from` commit from the range and includes
the `--to` commit. The `--to` commit defaults to
`HEAD` of the project's default branch.

```plaintext
glab changelog generate [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
# Generate a changelog for the version detected by 'git describe'
glab changelog generate

# Generate a changelog for a specific version
glab changelog generate --version 1.2.0

# Generate a changelog for commits between two SHAs
glab changelog generate --from abc123 --to def456

```
