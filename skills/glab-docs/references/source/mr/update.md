Update a merge request.

## Synopsis

Defaults to the currently checked-out branch. Use `--fill` to
automatically fill the title and description from the commit history.

`--attach` uploads a file and references it at the end of the description. Repeat the flag for more than one file, or pass `-` to read the file from standard input. Without `--description` the references are added to the description the merge request already has, instead of replacing it.

The `--attach` flag is an experiment. It might be
unstable or removed at any time, and is not ready for production use.
For more information, see
<https://docs.gitlab.com/policy/development_stages_support/>.
