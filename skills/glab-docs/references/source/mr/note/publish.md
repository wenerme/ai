Publish all pending review comments on a merge request. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Publish every pending review comment you created on a merge request with `glab mr note create --draft`. Only your own pending comments are published; other reviewers' pending comments are unaffected.

Use `--message` to add a summary note to the merge request when publishing, and `--internal` to restrict that summary to project members with at least the Reporter role.

Use `--reviewer-state` to set your review state on the merge request. Neither state records a formal approval; use `glab mr approve` to approve.

Unless you pass `--yes`, the command shows the number of pending comments and prompts you to confirm. When not running interactively, `--yes` is required. If there are no pending comments, the command exits with an error.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
