Update the body of one of your pending review comments. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Replace the body of a pending review comment before you publish the review. `<draft-note-id>` is the ID printed by `glab mr note draft create` or listed by `glab mr note draft list`.

You can change only the body. A pending diff comment stays on the same file and lines. Pending comments on images cannot be updated from the command line, because their position cannot be preserved.

`--attach` uploads a file and references it at the end of the comment. Repeat the flag for more than one file, or pass `-` to read the file from standard input. Without `--message` the references are added to the body the comment already has, instead of replacing it.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
