Manage your pending review comments on a merge request. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Pending review comments, also called draft notes, are visible only to you until you publish your review. Use these commands to add comments to a review, check and edit them, and then publish them all at once.

Each command acts only on your own pending comments. Other reviewers' pending comments are never listed, changed, or published.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
For more information, see
<https://docs.gitlab.com/policy/development_stages_support/>.
