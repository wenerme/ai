Delete one of your pending review comments from a merge request. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Discard a pending review comment before you publish the review. `<draft-note-id>` is the ID printed by `glab mr note draft create` or listed by `glab mr note draft list`.

Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Unless you pass `--yes`, the command shows the comment and prompts you to confirm. When not running interactively, `--yes` is required.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
For more information, see
