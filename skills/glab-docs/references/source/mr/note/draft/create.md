Add a pending review comment to a merge request. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Add a comment to your pending review. The comment stays visible only to you until you publish the review with `glab mr note draft publish` or submit it from the merge request page.

On success, the command prints the ID of the pending comment. Pass that ID to `glab mr note draft update` or `glab mr note draft delete`.

Use `--file` to place the comment on a specific file in the latest merge request diff version. Combine with `--line` (new side) or `--old-line` (old/removed side) to target a specific line. Omit both flags for a file-level comment.

Use `--reply` to reply to an existing discussion thread. The value can be a full discussion ID or a unique prefix of at least 8 characters. Find discussion IDs with `glab mr note list`.

The flag rules are:

- `--line` and `--old-line` require `--file`, and cannot be used together.
- `--file` and `--reply` are mutually exclusive.

`--attach` uploads a file and references it at the end of the comment. Repeat the flag for more than one file, or pass `-` to read the file from standard input. The upload happens immediately, even though the comment stays pending. An attachment is content on its own, so a comment with only `--attach` neither prompts nor reads a body from stdin.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.

## Examples

```console
# Add a pending comment to merge request 123
glab mr note draft create 123 -m "Consider renaming this."

# Add a pending comment to the current branch's merge request
glab mr note draft create -m "Looks good overall."

# Pipe the body from stdin
echo "Needs a test." | glab mr note draft create 123

# Add a pending diff comment on line 42 of main.go
glab mr note draft create 123 --file main.go --line 42 -m "Off-by-one?"

# Add a pending diff comment on lines 10-15
glab mr note draft create 123 --file main.go --line 10:15 -m "Extract this block."

# Add a pending diff comment on a removed line
glab mr note draft create 123 --file main.go --old-line 7 -m "Why was this removed?"

# Add a pending reply to an existing discussion thread
glab mr note draft create 123 --reply abc12345 -m "Agreed."

# Keep the ID of the pending comment for a later update
id=$(glab mr note draft create 123 -m "First pass")
