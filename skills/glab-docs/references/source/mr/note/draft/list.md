List your pending review comments on a merge request. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Human-readable output shows the ID of each pending comment, the file and line it targets, and the discussion it replies to. Pass the ID to `glab mr note draft update` or `glab mr note draft delete`.

JSON output returns the pending comment objects as the API reports them.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
