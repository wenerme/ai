Create a comment or discussion on a merge request. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Add a comment to a merge request. By default, the command creates the comment
as a new discussion thread.

Use `--resolvable=false` to create a non-resolvable note instead.
Non-resolvable notes do not block merging when the project requires
**All threads must be resolved**. Use this option for automation or status
updates that do not need a human to resolve them.

Use `--reply` to add a note to an existing discussion thread instead of
starting a new one. The value can be a full discussion ID or a unique
prefix of at least 8 characters.

Use `--file` to place a diff comment on a specific file in the latest
merge request diff version. Combine with `--line` (new side) or
`--old-line` (old/removed side) to target a specific line. Omit
both flags for a file-level comment.

The flag rules are:

- `--line` and `--old-line` require `--file`, and
cannot be used together.
- `--file`, `--reply`, and `--unique` are mutually
exclusive.
- `--resolvable=false` cannot be combined with `--reply`
or `--file` (and by extension `--line` or
`--old-line`).

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.

```plaintext
glab mr note create [<id> | <branch>] [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
# Add a comment to merge request 123
glab mr note create 123 -m "Looks good to me!"

# Add a comment to the current branch's merge request
glab mr note create -m "LGTM"

# Open editor to compose the message
glab mr note create 123

# Pipe from stdin
echo "LGTM" | glab mr note create 123

# Skip if already posted
glab mr note create 123 -m "LGTM" --unique

# Create a non-resolvable note, for example for bot or CI status updates
glab mr note create 123 -m "Build status: green" --resolvable=false

# Reply to an existing discussion thread
glab mr note create 123 --reply abc12345 -m "I agree!"

# Add a diff comment on line 42 of main.go
glab mr note create 123 --file main.go --line 42 -m "Needs refactoring"

# Add a diff comment on lines 10-15 (multiline range)
glab mr note create 123 --file main.go --line 10:15 -m "Extract this block"

# Add a diff comment on a removed line (old side)
glab mr note create 123 --file main.go --old-line 7 -m "Why was this removed?"

# Add a file-level diff comment (no line specified)
glab mr note create 123 --file main.go -m "General comment on this file"

```
