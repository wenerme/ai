Create a comment or discussion on a merge request. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Add a comment to a merge request. By default, the command creates the comment
as a new discussion thread.

Use `--resolvable=false` to create a non-resolvable note instead.
Non-resolvable notes do not block merging when the project requires
**All threads must be resolved**. Use this option for automation or status
updates that do not need a human to resolve them.

Use `--reply` to add a note to an existing discussion thread instead of
starting a new one. The value can be a full discussion ID or a unique
prefix of at least 8 characters. Find discussion IDs with
`glab mr note list`. Human-readable output uses
eight characters before the ellipsis, for example
`[discussion: abc12345…]`; pass
only those characters, for example `--reply abc12345`. To get a
full ID, use the `id` field of each discussion object:
`glab mr note list -F json | jq -r '.[].id'`.

Use `--file` to place a diff comment on a specific file in the latest
merge request diff version. Combine with `--line` (new side) or
`--old-line` (old/removed side) to target a specific line. Omit
both flags for a file-level comment.

The flag rules are:

- `--line` and `--old-line` require `--file`, and
cannot be used together.
- `--file`, `--reply`, and `--unique` are mutually
exclusive.
- `--resolvable=false` cannot be combined with `--reply`
or `--file` (and by extension `--line` or
`--old-line`).
- `--attach` and `--unique` are mutually exclusive,
because every upload gets a fresh URL and so an attached comment can
never match an existing one.

`--attach` uploads a file and references it at the end of the comment. Repeat the flag for more than one file, or pass `-` to read the file from standard input. An attachment is content on its own, so a comment with only `--attach` neither prompts nor reads a body from stdin.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.

```plaintext
glab mr note create [<id> | <branch>] [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
# Add a comment to merge request 123
glab mr note create 123 -m "Looks good to me!"

# Add a comment to the current branch's merge request
glab mr note create -m "LGTM"

# Open editor to compose the message
glab mr note create 123

# Pipe from stdin
echo "LGTM" | glab mr note create 123

# Read the body from a file
glab mr note create 123 < plan.md

# Skip if already posted
glab mr note create 123 -m "LGTM" --unique

# Create a non-resolvable note, for example for bot or CI status updates
glab mr note create 123 -m "Build status: green" --resolvable=false

# Reply to an existing discussion thread
glab mr note create 123 --reply abc12345 -m "I agree!"

# Add a diff comment on line 42 of main.go
glab mr note create 123 --file main.go --line 42 -m "Needs refactoring"

# Add a diff comment on lines 10-15 (multiline range)
glab mr note create 123 --file main.go --line 10:15 -m "Extract this block"

# Add a diff comment on a removed line (old side)
glab mr note create 123 --file main.go --old-line 7 -m "Why was this removed?"

# Add a file-level diff comment (no line specified)
glab mr note create 123 --file main.go -m "General comment on this file"

# Attach a screenshot alongside the message
glab mr note create 123 -m "Renders wrong here." --attach ./screenshot.png

# Attach an image piped from the clipboard
pngpaste - | glab mr note create 123 --attach -

```

## Options

      --attach stringArray   (EXPERIMENTAL) Upload a file and reference it at the end of the comment. Use "-" to read the file from standard input. Repeat the flag to attach multiple files.
      --file string          File path for a diff comment, like <path/to/file>. Targets the latest merge request diff version.
      --line string          Line in the new version. A single line number, like 42, or a range, like 10:15.
  -m, --message string       Comment or note message.
      --old-line int         Line in the old version, for commenting on a removed line.
