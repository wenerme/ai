Update the body of a note on a merge request. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Replace the body of an existing note on a merge request.

`<note-id>` is a numeric note ID, not a hex discussion ID.
You can find note IDs with:

- `glab mr note list -F json` (the `.id` field)
- Note URLs: `.../merge_requests/1#note_12345`

You can change only the note body. You cannot move the position of diff notes.

`--attach` uploads a file and references it at the end of the note. Repeat the flag for more than one file, or pass `-` to read the file from standard input. Without `--message` the references are added to the body the note already has, instead of replacing it.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
