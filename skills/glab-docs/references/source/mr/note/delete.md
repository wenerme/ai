Delete a note from a merge request. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Permanently delete a note from a merge request.

`<note-id>` is a numeric note ID, not a hex discussion ID.
You can find note IDs with:

- `glab mr note list -F json` (the `.id` field)
- Note URLs: `.../merge_requests/1#note_12345`

Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Unless you pass `--yes`,
the command prompts you to confirm.

This feature is an experiment and is not ready for production use.
It might be unstable or removed at any time.
For more information, see
<https://docs.gitlab.com/policy/development_stages_support/>.
