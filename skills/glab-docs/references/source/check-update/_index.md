Check for the latest glab version.

## Synopsis

Checks for the latest version of glab available on GitLab.com.

When you run this command explicitly, glab always checks for updates,
even if the previous check was less than 24 hours ago.

When glab runs this check automatically after other commands, it
checks for updates at most once every 24 hours.

To turn off the automatic update check, run
`glab config set check_update false`. To turn it back on,
run `glab config set check_update true`.
