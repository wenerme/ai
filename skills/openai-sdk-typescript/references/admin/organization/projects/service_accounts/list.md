### Returns

  - `role: "owner" | "member"`

    `owner` or `member`

    - `"owner"`

    - `"member"`

### Example

```typescript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
  adminAPIKey: process.env['OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY'], // This is the default and can be omitted
});

// Automatically fetches more pages as needed.
for await (const projectServiceAccount of client.admin.organization.projects.serviceAccounts.list(
  'project_id',
)) {
  console.log(projectServiceAccount.id);
}
