`client.admin.organization.projects.users.list(stringprojectID, UserListParamsquery?, RequestOptionsoptions?): ConversationCursorPage<ProjectUser>`

Returns a list of users in the project.

### Parameters

- `projectID: string`

### Returns

- `ProjectUser`

  Represents an individual user in a project.

  - `id: string`

    The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints

  - `added_at: number`

    The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the project was added.

  - `object: "organization.project.user"`

    The object type, which is always `organization.project.user`

    - `"organization.project.user"`

  - `role: string`

    `owner` or `member`

  - `email?: string | null`

    The email address of the user

  - `name?: string | null`

    The name of the user

### Example

```typescript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
  adminAPIKey: process.env['OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY'], // This is the default and can be omitted
});

// Automatically fetches more pages as needed.
for await (const projectUser of client.admin.organization.projects.users.list('project_id')) {
  console.log(projectUser.id);
}
```
