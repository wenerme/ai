  - `file_counts: FileCounts`

    - `cancelled: number`

      The number of files that were cancelled.

    - `completed: number`

      The number of files that have been successfully processed.

    - `failed: number`

    - `total: number`

      The total number of files.

  - `last_active_at: number | null`

    The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the vector store was last active.

  - `metadata: Metadata | null`

    Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be

    Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings
    with a maximum length of 512 characters.

  - `name: string`

    The name of the vector store.

  - `object: "vector_store"`

    The object type, which is always `vector_store`.

    - `"vector_store"`

  - `status: "expired" | "in_progress" | "completed"`

    The status of the vector store, which can be either `expired`, `in_progress`, or `completed`. A status of `completed` indicates that the vector store is ready for use.

    - `"expired"`

    - `"in_progress"`

    - `"completed"`

  - `usage_bytes: number`

    The total number of bytes used by the files in the vector store.

  - `expires_after?: ExpiresAfter`

    The expiration policy for a vector store.

    - `anchor: "last_active_at"`

      Anchor timestamp after which the expiration policy applies. Supported anchors: `last_active_at`.

      - `"last_active_at"`

    - `days: number`

      The number of days after the anchor time that the vector store will expire.

  - `expires_at?: number | null`

### Example

```typescript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env['OPENAI_API_KEY'], // This is the default and can be omitted
});

const vectorStore = await client.vectorStores.retrieve('vector_store_id');

console.log(vectorStore.id);
```
