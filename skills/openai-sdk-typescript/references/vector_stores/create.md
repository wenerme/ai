## Create

`client.vectorStores.create(VectorStoreCreateParamsbody, RequestOptionsoptions?): VectorStore`

**post** `/vector_stores`

Create a vector store.

### Parameters

- `body: VectorStoreCreateParams`

  - `chunking_strategy?: FileChunkingStrategyParam`

    The chunking strategy used to chunk the file(s). If not set, will use the `auto` strategy. Only applicable if `file_ids` is non-empty.

    - `AutoFileChunkingStrategyParam`

      The default strategy. This strategy currently uses a `max_chunk_size_tokens` of `800` and `chunk_overlap_tokens` of `400`.

      - `type: "auto"`

        Always `auto`.

        - `"auto"`

    - `StaticFileChunkingStrategyObjectParam`

      Customize your own chunking strategy by setting chunk size and chunk overlap.

      - `static: StaticFileChunkingStrategy`

        - `chunk_overlap_tokens: number`

          The number of tokens that overlap between chunks. The default value is `400`.

          Note that the overlap must not exceed half of `max_chunk_size_tokens`.

        - `max_chunk_size_tokens: number`

          The maximum number of tokens in each chunk. The default value is `800`. The minimum value is `100` and the maximum value is `4096`.

      - `type: "static"`

        Always `static`.

        - `"static"`

  - `description?: string`

    A description for the vector store. Can be used to describe the vector store's purpose.

  - `expires_after?: ExpiresAfter`

    The expiration policy for a vector store.

    - `anchor: "last_active_at"`

      Anchor timestamp after which the expiration policy applies. Supported anchors: `last_active_at`.

      - `"last_active_at"`

    - `days: number`

      The number of days after the anchor time that the vector store will expire.

  - `file_ids?: Array<string>`

    A list of [File](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files) IDs that the vector store should use. Useful for tools like `file_search` that can access files.

  - `metadata?: Metadata | null`

    Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be
    useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured
    format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

    Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings
    with a maximum length of 512 characters.

  - `name?: string`

    The name of the vector store.

### Returns

- `VectorStore`

  A vector store is a collection of processed files can be used by the `file_search` tool.

  - `id: string`

    The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints.

  - `created_at: number`

    The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the vector store was created.

  - `file_counts: FileCounts`

    - `cancelled: number`

      The number of files that were cancelled.

    - `completed: number`

      The number of files that have been successfully processed.

    - `failed: number`

      The number of files that have failed to process.

    - `in_progress: number`

      The number of files that are currently being processed.

    - `total: number`

      The total number of files.

  - `last_active_at: number | null`

    The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the vector store was last active.

  - `metadata: Metadata | null`

    Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be
    useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured
    format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

    Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings
    with a maximum length of 512 characters.

  - `name: string`

    The name of the vector store.

  - `object: "vector_store"`

    The object type, which is always `vector_store`.

    - `"vector_store"`

  - `status: "expired" | "in_progress" | "completed"`

    The status of the vector store, which can be either `expired`, `in_progress`, or `completed`. A status of `completed` indicates that the vector store is ready for use.

    - `"expired"`

    - `"in_progress"`

    - `"completed"`

  - `usage_bytes: number`

    The total number of bytes used by the files in the vector store.

  - `expires_after?: ExpiresAfter`

    The expiration policy for a vector store.

    - `anchor: "last_active_at"`

      Anchor timestamp after which the expiration policy applies. Supported anchors: `last_active_at`.

      - `"last_active_at"`

    - `days: number`

      The number of days after the anchor time that the vector store will expire.

  - `expires_at?: number | null`

    The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the vector store will expire.

### Example

```typescript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env['OPENAI_API_KEY'], // This is the default and can be omitted
});

const vectorStore = await client.vectorStores.create();

console.log(vectorStore.id);
```
