    useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured
    format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard. Keys are strings
    with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum
    length of 512 characters, booleans, or numbers.

    - `string`

    - `number`

    - `boolean`

  - `chunking_strategy?: FileChunkingStrategy`

    The strategy used to chunk the file.

    - `StaticFileChunkingStrategyObject`

      - `static: StaticFileChunkingStrategy`

        - `chunk_overlap_tokens: number`

          The number of tokens that overlap between chunks. The default value is `400`.
