## Create

`client.uploads.create(UploadCreateParamsbody, RequestOptionsoptions?): Upload`

**post** `/uploads`

Creates an intermediate [Upload](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/uploads/object) object
that you can add [Parts](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/uploads/part-object) to.
Currently, an Upload can accept at most 8 GB in total and expires after an
hour after you create it.

Once you complete the Upload, we will create a
[File](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/object) object that contains all the parts
you uploaded. This File is usable in the rest of our platform as a regular
File object.

For certain `purpose` values, the correct `mime_type` must be specified.
Please refer to documentation for the
[supported MIME types for your use case](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search#supported-files).

For guidance on the proper filename extensions for each purpose, please
follow the documentation on [creating a
File](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/create).

Returns the Upload object with status `pending`.

### Example

```typescript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env['OPENAI_API_KEY'], // This is the default and can be omitted
});

const upload = await client.uploads.create({
  bytes: 0,
