This API reference describes the standard, streaming, and real-time APIs you can
use to interact with the Gemini models. You can use the REST APIs in any
environment that supports HTTP requests. Refer to the
[Quickstart guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/quickstart) for how to
get started with your first API call. If you're looking for the references for
our language-specific libraries and SDKs, go to the link for that language in
the left navigation under **SDK references**.

## Primary endpoints

The Gemini API is organized around the following major endpoints:

- **Standard content generation ([`generateContent`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#method:-models.generatecontent)):** A standard REST endpoint that processes your request and returns the model's full response in a single package. This is best for non-interactive tasks where you can wait for the entire result.
- **Streaming content generation ([`streamGenerateContent`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#method:-models.streamgeneratecontent)):** Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push chunks of the response to you as they are generated. This provides a faster, more interactive experience for applications like chatbots.
- **Live API ([`BidiGenerateContent`](https://ai.google.dev/api/live#send-messages)):** A stateful WebSocket-based API for bi-directional streaming, designed for real-time conversational use cases.
- **Batch mode ([`batchGenerateContent`](https://ai.google.dev/api/batch-mode)):** A standard REST endpoint for submitting batches of `generateContent` requests.
- **Embeddings ([`embedContent`](https://ai.google.dev/api/embeddings)):** A standard REST endpoint that generates a text embedding vector from the input `Content`.
- **Gen Media APIs:** Endpoints for generating media with our specialized models such as [Imagen for image generation](https://ai.google.dev/api/models#method:-models.predict), and [Veo for video generation](https://ai.google.dev/api/models#method:-models.predictlongrunning). Gemini also has these capabilities built in which you can access using the `generateContent` API.
- **Platform APIs:** Utility endpoints that support core capabilities such as [uploading files](https://ai.google.dev/api/files), and [counting tokens](https://ai.google.dev/api/tokens).

## Authentication

All requests to the Gemini API must include a `x-goog-api-key` header with your
API key. Create one with a few clicks in [Google AI
Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

The following is an example request with the API key included in the header:

    curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent" \
      -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -X POST \
      -d '{
        "contents": [
          {
            "parts": [
              {
                "text": "Explain how AI works in a few words"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }'

For instructions on how to pass your key to the API using Gemini SDKs,
see the [Using Gemini API keys](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) guide.

## Content generation

This is the central endpoint for sending prompts to the model. There are two
endpoints for generating content, the key difference is how you receive the
response:

- **[`generateContent`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#method:-models.generatecontent)
  (REST)**: Receives a request and provides a single response after the model has finished its entire generation.
- **[`streamGenerateContent`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#method:-models.streamgeneratecontent)
  (SSE)**: Receives the exact same request, but the model streams back chunks of the response as they are generated. This provides a better user experience for interactive applications as it lets you display partial results immediately.

### Request body structure

The [request body](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#request-body) is a JSON object that is
**identical** for both standard and streaming modes and is built from a few core
objects:

- [`Content`](https://ai.google.dev/api/caching#Content) object: Represents a single turn in a conversation.
- [`Part`](https://ai.google.dev/api/caching#Part) object: A piece of data within a `Content` turn (like text or an image).
- `inline_data` ([`Blob`](https://ai.google.dev/api/caching#Blob)): A container for raw media bytes and their MIME type.

At the highest level, the request body contains a `contents` object, which is a
list of `Content` objects, each representing turns in conversation. In most
cases, for basic text generation, you will have a single `Content` object, but
if you'd like to maintain conversation history, you can use multiple `Content`
objects.

The following shows a typical `generateContent` request body:

    curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent" \
      -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -X POST \
      -d '{
        "contents": [
          {
              "role": "user",
              "parts": [
                  // A list of Part objects goes here
              ]
          },
          {
              "role": "model",
              "parts": [
                  // A list of Part objects goes here
              ]
          }
        ]
      }'

### Response body structure

The [response body](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#response-body) is similar for both
the streaming and standard modes except for the following:

- Standard mode: The response body contains an instance of [`GenerateContentResponse`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#v1beta.GenerateContentResponse).
- Streaming mode: The response body contains a stream of [`GenerateContentResponse`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#v1beta.GenerateContentResponse) instances.

At a high level, the response body contains a `candidates` object, which is a
list of `Candidate` objects. The `Candidate` object contains a `Content`
object that has the generated response returned from the model.

## Request examples

The following examples show how these components come together for different
types of requests.

### Text-only prompt

A simple text prompt consists of a `contents` array with a single `Content`
object. That object's `parts` array, in turn, contains a single `Part` object
with a `text` field.

    curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent" \
      -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -X POST \
      -d '{
        "contents": [
          {
            "parts": [
              {
                "text": "Explain how AI works in a single paragraph."
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }'

### Multimodal prompt (text and image)

To provide both text and an image in a prompt, the `parts` array should contain
two `Part` objects: one for the text, and one for the image `inline_data`.

    curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent" \
    -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X POST \
    -d '{
        "contents": [{
        "parts":[
            {
                "inline_data": {
                "mime_type":"image/jpeg",
                "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQ... (base64-encoded image)"
                }
            },
            {"text": "What is in this picture?"},
          ]
        }]
      }'

### Multi-turn conversations (chat)

To build a conversation with multiple turns, you define the `contents` array
with multiple `Content` objects. The API will use this entire history as context
for the next response. The `role` for each `Content` object should alternate
between `user` and `model`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The client SDKs provide a chat interface that manages this list for you automatically. When using the REST API, you are responsible for maintaining the conversation history.

    curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent" \
      -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -X POST \
      -d '{
        "contents": [
          {
            "role": "user",
            "parts": [
              { "text": "Hello." }
            ]
          },
          {
            "role": "model",
            "parts": [
              { "text": "Hello! How can I help you today?" }
            ]
          },
          {
            "role": "user",
            "parts": [
              { "text": "Please write a four-line poem about the ocean." }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }'

### Key takeaways

- `Content` is the envelope: It's the top-level container for a message turn, whether it's from the user or the model.
- `Part` enables multimodality: Use multiple `Part` objects within a single `Content` object to combine different types of data (text, image, video URI, etc.).
- Choose your data method:
  - For small, directly embedded media (like most images), use a `Part` with `inline_data`.
  - For larger files or files you want to reuse across requests, use the File API to upload the file and reference it with a `file_data` part.
- Manage conversation history: For chat applications using the REST API, build the `contents` array by appending `Content` objects for each turn, alternating between `"user"` and `"model"` roles. If you're using an SDK, refer to the SDK documentation for the recommended way to manage conversation history.

## Response examples

The following examples show how these components come together for different
types of requests.

### Text-only response

A default text response consists of a `candidates` array with one or more
`content` objects that contain the model's response.

The following is an example of a **standard** response:

    {
      "candidates": [
        {
          "content": {
            "parts": [
              {
                "text": "At its core, Artificial Intelligence works by learning from vast amounts of data ..."
              }
            ],
            "role": "model"
          },
          "finishReason": "STOP",
          "index": 1
        }
      ],
    }

The following is series of **streaming** responses. Each response contains a
`responseId` that ties the full response together:

    {
      "candidates": [
        {
          "content": {
            "parts": [
              {
                "text": "The image displays"
              }
            ],
            "role": "model"
          },
          "index": 0
        }
      ],
      "usageMetadata": {
        "promptTokenCount": ...
      },
      "modelVersion": "gemini-2.5-flash-lite",
      "responseId": "mAitaLmkHPPlz7IPvtfUqQ4"
    }

    ...

    {
      "candidates": [
        {
          "content": {
            "parts": [
              {
                "text": " the following materials:\n\n*   **Wood:** The accordion and the violin are primarily"
              }
            ],
            "role": "model"
          },
          "index": 0
        }
      ],
      "usageMetadata": {
        "promptTokenCount": ...
      }
      "modelVersion": "gemini-2.5-flash-lite",
      "responseId": "mAitaLmkHPPlz7IPvtfUqQ4"
    }

## Live API (BidiGenerateContent) WebSockets API

Live API offers a stateful WebSocket based API for bi-directional streaming to
enable real-time streaming use cases. You can review
[Live API guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live) and the [Live API reference](https://ai.google.dev/api/live)
for more details.

## Specialized models

In addition to the Gemini family of models, Gemini API offers endpoints for
specialized models such as [Imagen](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/imagen),
[Lyria](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/music-generation) and
[embedding](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/embeddings) models. You can check out
these guides under the Models section.

## Platform APIs

The rest of the endpoints enable additional capabilities to use with the main
endpoints described so far. Check out topics
[Batch mode](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/batch-mode) and
[File API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/files) in the Guides section to learn more.
