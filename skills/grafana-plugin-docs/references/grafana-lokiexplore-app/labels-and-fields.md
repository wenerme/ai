# Labels and fields

Grafana Logs Drilldown visualizes log volume for labels attached to your log lines, and for fields automatically extracted from each log line.

> Note
>
> The type of data being expressed in a label or field may require different treatments. For example, fields expressing `bytes` are visualized differently than other types of data. [Share your feedback](https://forms.gle/1sYWCTPvD72T1dPH9) if you have suggestions for how to improve this experience.

Logs Drilldown adds a special `detected_level` label to all log lines where Loki assigns a level of the log line, including `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, `critical`, `trace`, or `unknown` if no level could be determined.

Label visualizations are helpful for:

- Spotting unexpected spikes in log volume.
- Noticing dips or outages in your services.
- Understanding the distribution of log lines across your labels.
- Identifying labels that might be useful for filtering or grouping your logs.

You can click the **Select** button on a Label or Field graph to access a breakdown of its values, seeing the log volumes visualized along the way. This can be useful for understanding the traits of your system, and for spotting spikes or other changes.

Click individual log lines to view the **Log Details** panel which displays fields and labels with filtering options. For more information about Log Details, refer to [View logs](../view-logs/).

## Filtering logs by label

To explore labels with your own data, follow these steps:

1. From the Grafana main menu, select **Drilldown** &gt; **Logs**.
2. Click **Show logs** for the service you want to explore.
3. Click the **Labels** tab on the service details page.
4. Browse the labels detected for this service.
5. Look for an interesting label and click the **Select** button.

You will see a selection of visualizations showing the volume of each label.

To remove the filter, select **All** from the **Label** search menu or click the **x** next to the selection in the Filter fields at the top of the page.

## Fields tab user interface overview

Let’s take a closer look at what you can do on the Fields tab.

- **Grid / Rows**: Lets you select how fields are displayed.
- **Volume / Names**: Lets you toggle between showing field volume graphs and showing field names only.
- **Extract fields from logs**: Toggle on to apply logfmt and JSON parsers to your queries so that fields detected in the log lines appear alongside indexed labels and structured metadata.
- **Include** or **Add to filter** button: Lets you filter log results by a specific field value. The button label varies depending on the field type.
- **Select** button (value breakdown): Click to access a breakdown of the field’s values, seeing the log volumes visualized along the way.
- **Menu** (three dots): Opens the panel menu, where you can navigate to [Grafana Explore](/docs/grafana-cloud/visualizations/explore/) and access other options. For details, refer to [View logs](../view-logs/#panel-menu).
