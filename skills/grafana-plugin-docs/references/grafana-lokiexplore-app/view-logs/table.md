# Logs Drilldown table view

The **Table** view in Grafana Logs Drilldown displays your logs in a table with a column for each displayed field, so you can scan structured logs the way you’d read a spreadsheet.

Use the table view when you want to scan, compare, and sort log data. For example, you can sort by duration to find the slowest requests, compare status codes or Pod names across many log lines.

To open the table view, select **Show logs** for your service in Logs Drilldown, then select the **Table** radio button in the panel header, next to **Logs** and **JSON**.

## The Logs Table visualization

> Note
>
> The Logs Table visualization is currently in [public preview](/docs/release-life-cycle/). Grafana Labs offers limited support, and breaking changes might occur prior to the feature being made generally available.
>
> To use this feature, enable the logsTablePanelNG feature toggle in your Grafana configuration file or contact Support.

When you enable the feature toggle, the **Table** view renders your logs with the native Grafana Logs Table visualization, described on this page.

## Select and organize columns

Use the sidebar on the left of the table to choose which fields appear as columns. For example, to build a table with only the fields you care about:

1. Select the **Table** view in the panel header.
2. Click **Search fields by name** and enter a full or partial field name.
3. Select the field’s checkbox to add it as a column, and clear the checkboxes of any columns you don’t need.

The sidebar offers the following controls:

Expand table

| Action                  | UI element                   | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Find a field            | **Search fields by name**    | Type a field name to filter the list of available fields.                                                                                                             |
| Add or remove a column  | Field checkbox               | Select a field’s checkbox to add it as a column, or clear the checkbox to remove it.                                                                                  |
| Reorder columns         | **Selected fields**          | Lists the current columns. Drag fields in this list to reorder the columns.                                                                                           |
| Browse available fields | **Suggested** and **Fields** | **Suggested** offers likely useful fields, and **Fields** lists everything else. The percentage next to a field shows how many of the displayed log lines contain it. |
| Restore defaults        | **Reset**                    | Restores the default columns: the time, level, and log line fields.                                                                                                   |

To give the table more room, collapse the sidebar with the **Collapse sidebar** icon. You can also resize the sidebar, the columns, and the log details sidebar by dragging their edges. Logs Drilldown remembers your column selection and sizes.

## View log details

Each row has a **Show details** eye icon at the start of the line.

[Log details in the table view](/media/docs/explore-logs/v2/logs-drilldown-table-show-details-copy-menu.png)

Select **Show details** to open the log details sidebar, where you can search fields, copy the log line, filter for or out field values, and view field statistics. Refer to [View logs](../#log-details) for explanations.

In the table view:

- Log details always open as a sidebar on the right, which you can resize or close with the **Close log details sidebar** icon or the Escape key.
- The copy icon at the top of the sidebar opens a menu with **Copy log line message** and **Copy log contents as JSON** options, as shown in the previous image.
- Opening details for several rows creates a tab for each log line, so you can compare them.
- Use the up and down arrow keys to move the details view to the previous or next log line.

Rows also have a **Copy link to log line** icon that copies a short link to that log line to your clipboard.

## Filter, sort, wrap, and download

The table view uses the columns themselves for filtering, plus a controls rail on the right edge of the panel.

### Filter by level and by value

Every column header has a **Filter** icon, which opens a list of that column’s values to filter by. To filter by log level, use the **Filter** icon on the level column, for example `detected_level`.

You can also hover over any cell and use **Filter for value** or **Filter out value** to add that value to your query, or filter from within [log details](#view-log-details). The **Log levels** filter in the Logs Drilldown toolbar applies to the table view as well.

### Sort

Click a column header to sort by that column, and click again to flip the direction. The sort order control in the rail switches between newest and oldest logs first, and stays in sync with the time column.

### Wrap text

Select the wrap control in the rail to toggle text wrapping for long log lines and cell values.

### Download

Use the **Download logs** control in the rail to export the displayed logs as `txt`, `json`, or `csv`.

The export includes the columns you’ve selected. In dashboards, the download control appears when you enable the **Display download control** panel option.
