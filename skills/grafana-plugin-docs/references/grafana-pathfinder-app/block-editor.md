# Block editor

The block editor is a visual authoring tool built into Pathfinder. You can use it to compose your own interactive guides without writing any JSON, save them as drafts, publish them to your Grafana instance, and update them as your processes change.

## Who can use the block editor

The block editor is available to users with **editor** or **admin** permissions in Grafana. The editor tab does not appear in the sidebar for viewers. Published guides are visible to **all** users on the Grafana instance, regardless of role.

Custom guides are private to the Grafana stack they are published on — they are stored in the Pathfinder backend that runs alongside Grafana and are not shared between stacks or organizations.

## Open the block editor

The block editor lives inside the Pathfinder docs panel.

1. Click the **Help** icon in the top navigation bar to open the Pathfinder sidebar.
2. In the sidebar’s tab bar, click the **Editor** tab (pencil icon).

If you don’t see the Editor tab, your account does not have the editor or admin role on this Grafana instance — ask an administrator to update your permissions.

## Anatomy of the editor

When you open the editor for a new guide, you see the empty canvas:

Expand table

| Area                         | What it does                                                                                                           |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Title** (top)              | Click to give your guide a name. Pathfinder generates a unique ID from the title on first save.                        |
| **Status badge** (top right) | Tracks where the guide lives — Saved (browser only), Draft, Draft modified, Published, Published modified.             |
| **New**                      | Start a fresh guide. The current guide is auto-saved before clearing.                                                  |
| **View mode toggle**         | Switch between Edit, Preview, and JSON views.                                                                          |
| **Pop out**                  | Detach the guide into a floating, resizable window — useful when you need the right sidebar for something else.        |
| **More actions** (⋮)         | Import a guide from JSON, copy/download the current guide as JSON, take a guided tour, and (when published) unpublish. |
| **Add Block** (bottom)       | Open the block palette to choose the next block to add.                                                                |

## Create your first guide

The fastest way to learn the editor is to build a small guide end to end.

### 1. Name your guide

Click the title at the top and type a name. Press **Enter** or click away to confirm. The first time you save, the editor creates a unique guide ID by slugifying the title and appending a four-character random suffix (for example, `setting-up-dashboards-a3f9`). The ID is locked after the first save — renaming the title later does not change it.

### 2. Add your first block

Click **+ Add Block** at the bottom of the editor. The block palette opens with every block type available on this instance:

Pick **Markdown** for a plain text introduction. Each block type opens its own form:

Fill in the content and click **Add block**. The form closes and your block appears in the canvas.

### 3. Add interactive steps

To teach a user how to do something in Grafana, add an **Interactive** block. The form has an Action Type dropdown (highlight, button, form fill, navigate, hover, info, popout) and a Target selector field with a built-in **Pick element** button:

The **Pick element** button activates a click-anywhere selector picker — point at the element you want the guide to highlight, click it, and the editor fills in the most stable selector it can find. The Selector Health badge next to the field gives you a green/yellow/red signal on how robust the selector is, and the **Test** button flashes the matched element on the page so you can confirm it’s the right one.

For automated sequences, use a **Multistep** block (the system performs each step in order when the user clicks Do it). For sequences the user must perform themselves, use a **Guided** block (the system highlights each step and waits for the user to act).

### 4. Group steps with sections

When you have several related steps, wrap them in a **Section** block. Sections give the user a single “Do section” button that runs the entire sequence and adds clear visual structure to your guide.

If you turn on **Add and record**, the editor immediately enters [recording mode](#record-interactive-steps) and captures every interaction you perform in Grafana as steps inside the new section.

### 5. Build out the guide

Keep adding blocks until your guide tells a complete story. The canvas shows each block in order with quick edit, duplicate, and delete buttons:

You can drag blocks by their handle to reorder them, or use **Select blocks** to pick several in one go (useful for merging sequential steps into a single multistep block).

### 6. Save and publish

The primary button in the header reflects your guide’s lifecycle. Start with **Save as draft** — see the [Save, publish, and update](#save-publish-and-update) section below for the full flow.

## The block types

Expand table

| Block           | Use it for                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Markdown**    | Formatted text — headings, lists, code blocks, tables, links.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Image**       | An embedded image with optional dimensions.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Video**       | A YouTube embed or a native HTML5 video.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Section**     | A container that groups related steps and adds a “Do section” button.                                                                                                                            |
| **Collapsible** | A container that hides its content behind a toggle the user expands.                                                                                                                             |
| **Conditional** | Two branches of content — show one branch when conditions pass, the other when they fail. Conditions use the same syntax as requirements (for example, `has-datasource:prometheus`, `is-admin`). |
| **Interactive** | A single step with **Show me** and **Do it** buttons that highlight or perform an action in Grafana.                                                                                             |
| **Multistep**   | A sequence of actions that runs automatically when the user clicks **Do it**.                                                                                                                    |
| **Guided**      | A sequence the user performs themselves — Pathfinder highlights each step and waits for the user to act.                                                                                         |
| **Quiz**        | A knowledge-check with single or multiple-choice answers.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Input**       | A prompt that collects a value from the user (text, checkbox, or data source picker) and stores it as a variable for later steps to reference.                                                   |
| **Code block**  | A code snippet with copy-to-clipboard and, in supported contexts, an Insert button that types the code into a Grafana Monaco editor.                                                             |
| **Challenge**   | A hands-on task the user has to solve, with progressive hints and a **Check my work** button that evaluates a success condition. Runs against the user’s own Grafana or in a sandbox VM.         |
| **Grot guide**  | A choose-your-own-adventure decision tree where each screen offers options that branch to other screens.                                                                                         |
| **Snippet**     | A reference to a published snippet — the guide always renders the latest version of the snippet’s content.                                                                                       |

If your administrator has enabled the Coda terminal integration, the palette also exposes **Terminal** (a runnable shell command) and **Terminal connect** (a button that provisions a sandbox VM and opens a terminal panel) blocks. A challenge block only needs the terminal integration when it runs in sandbox VM mode.

## Record interactive steps

You don’t have to write selectors by hand. Click **Add and record** on a section block, or **Record** on an empty multistep or guided block, to enter recording mode. A banner appears at the bottom of the screen and the editor watches what you do in Grafana:

- A click on a button is recorded as a `button` action.
- Typing in an input is recorded as a `formfill` action when you blur the field.
- Hold **Shift** while clicking to record a `hover` step instead of a click — handy for menus and rows that only show their actions on hover.
- Hold **Alt** while clicking to force a `formfill` capture on any element.

Click **Stop** in the banner when you’re done. Each recorded action becomes a step inside the active block. You can then edit individual steps (drag to reorder, change action type, tweak target, add tooltips) just like manually-created ones.

## Save, publish, and update

Pathfinder tracks two storage tiers for every guide:

- **Browser (localStorage)** — auto-saves while you work so a refresh never loses progress. The “Saved” / “Saving…” indicator in the header reflects this.
- **Pathfinder backend** — saves drafts and published guides on the server. The status badge (Draft, Published, etc.) reflects this.

### Lifecycle

Expand table

| Current state              | Primary button      | What it does                                                          |
|----------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Not saved                  | **Save as draft**   | Saves to the backend as a draft. Assigns a guide ID if one isn’t set. |
| Draft, no changes          | **Publish**         | Makes the guide live in the docs panel for all users.                 |
| Draft, unsaved changes     | **Update draft**    | Saves your latest changes to the draft without publishing.            |
| Published, no changes      | (no primary action) | The guide is live and in sync.                                        |
| Published, unsaved changes | **Update**          | Pushes your latest changes to the live guide.                         |

The **⋮** menu always exposes the alternative actions for your current state — for example, **Publish** when the primary is Update draft, or **Unpublish** when the guide is published:

### Edit a published guide

1. Open the **Library** from the editor header.
2. Click **Load** next to the guide.
3. Make your changes — the badge changes to **Published (modified)**.
4. Click **Update** to push the changes live. Users see the new version on their next refresh.

### Unpublish

Open the **⋮** menu and pick **Unpublish**. The guide disappears from the docs panel immediately, but the draft stays in your library so you can re-publish whenever you’re ready.

## The guide library

Click **Library** in the header to see every guide stored in the Pathfinder backend, both drafts and published. From the library you can:

- **Load** a guide into the editor for editing.
- **Delete** a guide permanently (you’ll be asked to confirm).
- **Refresh** the list to pick up changes made by other authors.

Drafts are only visible in the library — they don’t appear in the docs panel sidebar. Only published guides reach end users.

## View modes

The view mode toggle in the header switches between three views of the same guide.

### Edit

The default authoring view. The block palette and per-block edit/delete buttons are all available.

### Preview

A read-only render of how the guide looks to end users. Use it to check formatting, conditional branches, and overall flow before you publish.

### JSON

The raw JSON of the guide. You can edit it directly here for fine-grained tweaks or to paste in a guide someone else shared with you.

If your edit produces invalid JSON, the editor refuses to switch back to Edit mode until you fix it.

## The pop out button

The **Pop out** button next to the view mode toggle detaches the entire docs panel into a floating, resizable, draggable window. This is helpful when:

- You’re recording a guide and need the right sidebar for something else (for example, Grafana Assistant).
- You want to compare side-by-side what an end user sees while you author.
- You’re presenting and need the guide above another tool.

You can drag the floating window anywhere on screen, resize it from any edge, or minimize it to a small pill. Click **Pop out** again (or drag the window back to the right edge) to dock it back into the sidebar.

You can also build a `popout` step type into your guide — see [Interactive types](../../developer/interactive-examples/interactive-types.md#popout) for the schema reference.

## Troubleshooting

### The Editor tab isn’t visible

You need editor or admin permissions on this Grafana instance. Ask an administrator to update your role, or check that you’re logged in as the right user.

### Selector Health badge is yellow or red

The badge measures how stable the selector is likely to be across Grafana versions. Yellow usually means the selector is too generic (matches several elements). Red typically means it depends on auto-generated CSS class names that are likely to change. Use **Pick element** again, or click **Show alternatives** in the form to see other candidates with their stability scores.

### Recording captured the wrong step

Stop recording, edit or delete the unwanted step from the canvas, and start a new recording. Steps captured during recording are otherwise identical to manually-created ones, so any post-recording cleanup happens in the same forms.

### “Save as draft” is greyed out

The Pathfinder backend isn’t reachable. The editor falls back to localStorage-only saving when this happens, so your work is not lost — but you need backend connectivity to save, publish, or share guides. Check with your Grafana administrator that the Pathfinder backend is healthy.

### My guide doesn’t appear in the docs panel after publishing

Refresh the page. The docs panel reads the list of published custom guides on load.
