# Administrator reference

Interactive learning, also called Pathfinder, provides contextual documentation and interactive guides inside Grafana. Use its settings to control availability and the learning experience for your Grafana organization.

## Open the configuration page

You need the Admin role in the Grafana organization to change these settings.

1. Open **Administration** &gt; **Plugins and data** &gt; **Plugins**.
2. Search for `Interactive learning` and select the plugin.
3. Select **Configuration**.

You can also open the sidebar’s **More options** menu and select **Settings**. In Grafana Cloud, **Classic Help menu settings** opens the same page.

The direct path on your Grafana instance is `/plugins/grafana-pathfinder-app?page=configuration`. This page remains accessible when Pathfinder is disabled.

## Disable Interactive learning in Grafana Cloud

To restore Grafana’s classic **Help** menu for everyone in the current Grafana organization:

1. Open the plugin’s **Configuration** tab.
2. In the **Interactive learning** section, turn off **Enable Pathfinder**.
3. Select **Save configuration**. The page reloads after a successful save.
4. Ask users who already have Grafana open to reload their pages.

After users reload and the saved setting loads, Pathfinder’s sidebar, guide launch links, kiosk, and interactive actions are unavailable. The classic **Help** menu returns. Existing learning progress is kept, and disabling Pathfinder does not delete saved custom guides.

This setting applies to the current Grafana organization, not every stack in your Grafana Cloud account. Repeat the procedure in each organization where you want to disable Pathfinder. Closing the sidebar only closes your panel; it does not disable Pathfinder for other users.

> Note
>
> If the saved setting cannot be read when Grafana loads, Pathfinder can remain available. If the sidebar still appears, check that the setting saved successfully, reload, and contact your Grafana administrator or Grafana Cloud support if the problem continues.

### Re-enable Interactive learning

Return to the same **Configuration** page, turn on **Enable Pathfinder**, and select **Save configuration**. Users must reload Grafana to apply the change.

Grafana Cloud also controls availability during the public preview. If the page displays **Pathfinder is disabled remotely**, turning on the local setting cannot override that restriction. Your saved preference applies when Grafana Cloud makes Pathfinder available again.

### Disable recommendations only

To keep guides available while stopping context-aware recommendation requests:

1. Select the **Recommendations** tab on the plugin page.
2. Turn off **Enable context-aware recommendations**.
3. Select **Save settings**.

This is separate from **Enable Pathfinder**. Bundled guides remain available, and online browsers can fetch the public guide catalog and content. For details about data usage, refer to [Terms and conditions](../terms-and-conditions/).

## Configure recommendations

Context-aware recommendations use the current Grafana page and other contextual information to suggest relevant documentation and guides.

The service is enabled by default in Grafana Cloud. On self-managed Grafana, an administrator must review the data usage notice and enable **Enable context-aware recommendations** on the **Recommendations** tab, then select **Save settings**.

For an overview of content sources and data handling, refer to [Interactive learning architecture](../architecture/).

## Choose how guides open

The following settings are on the **Configuration** tab. Select **Save configuration** after changing them.

### Auto-launch a guide

Set **Auto-launch tutorial URL** to the URL of a guide or documentation page to open when the sidebar opens. For example, use `https://grafana.com/tutorials/grafana-fundamentals/` for introductory material. Clear the field to stop automatically selecting that content.

### Open documentation links in the sidebar

Turn on **Intercept documentation links globally** to open supported Grafana documentation links in Interactive learning. This feature is experimental.

To open a link in a separate browser tab instead, hold **Ctrl** on Windows or Linux, hold **Cmd** on macOS, or middle-click the link.

### Open the sidebar when Grafana loads

Turn on **Automatically open Interactive learning panel when Grafana loads** to open the sidebar on the initial page load. This feature is experimental. It does not reopen the sidebar on every navigation within Grafana.

If a user starts in Grafana’s onboarding flow, opening is deferred until they leave that flow.

## Configure interactive guide behavior

Use the **Interactive features** tab to adjust how steps behave. Select **Save configuration** to apply changes. To restore the defaults on this tab, select **Reset to defaults**, then **Save configuration**.

| Setting                                       | Behavior                                                                                                                      | Default   |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Enable automatic step completion              | Detects supported actions you perform yourself and marks their steps complete after checking requirements. Experimental.      | On        |
| Disable auto-collapse on section completion   | Keeps completed sections expanded. Readers can still collapse them manually.                                                  | Off       |
| Requirements check timeout                    | Time allowed for requirement validation, from 1,000 to 10,000 ms.                                                             | 3,000 ms  |
| Guided step timeout                           | Time allowed to complete a guided step, from 5,000 to 120,000 ms.                                                             | 30,000 ms |
| Enable AI-powered “Fix this” on failing steps | Offers Grafana Assistant help when a target cannot be found and built-in recovery is unavailable. Requires Grafana Assistant. | On        |
| Enable “Open in interactive window”           | Allows a guide in a separate browser tab to control the original Grafana tab after pairing.                                   | Off       |

Turning off automatic step completion does not prevent a reader from using **Do it** or the guide’s **Mark complete** control. Accepted AI repair suggestions affect the guide in the current session; they do not publish changes to the saved guide. Turning off AI repair leaves built-in recovery available.

### Use a separate interactive window

The two-tab controller is experimental. When enabled, **Open in interactive window** opens the guide in another browser tab. Pairing requires a one-time code and explicit acceptance in the original Grafana tab. Once paired, guide actions run in that original tab with the signed-in user’s permissions. Enable this feature only for trusted guide content and instances.

## Manage custom guides

Users with the Editor or Admin role can open **More options** &gt; **Create guide** in the sidebar. Dev mode is not required.

Saving and publishing guides requires the Pathfinder storage service to be available on the instance and the user to have permission to write guides. If storage is unavailable, authors can still work locally and export guide JSON. Published guides are available to users in the same Grafana organization; they are not automatically shared to other stacks.

For draft, publishing, sharing, and import instructions, refer to the [Block editor guide](../block-editor/).

## Kiosk mode

Kiosk mode displays a full-screen catalog of guides for demonstrations or onboarding.

1. Open the **Interactive features** tab.
2. Turn on **Enable kiosk mode**.
3. Optionally set **Rules JSON URL** to a custom catalog.
4. Select **Save configuration**.
5. Open **More options** &gt; **Kiosk mode** in the sidebar.

A catalog opened from the sidebar can launch guides in a new browser tab. Select **Exit kiosk** or press **Escape** to return to Grafana.

### Open a kiosk from a link

Add `pathfinderKiosk=1` to a Grafana URL to open a kiosk. This works even when the **Enable kiosk mode** setting is off, but Pathfinder itself must be available. The link does not change the saved setting.

text [Copy code to clipboard] Copy

```text
https://your-stack.grafana.net/?pathfinderKiosk=1
```

To choose a different catalog, add `kioskRulesUrl` with the URL-encoded address of the catalog JSON:

text [Copy code to clipboard] Copy

```text
https://your-stack.grafana.net/?pathfinderKiosk=1&kioskRulesUrl=https%3A%2F%2Finteractive-learning.grafana.net%2Fmy-kiosk.json
```

Replace the example catalog address with your published catalog. If your Grafana URL already has a query string, append parameters with `&`.

Guides selected from a URL-launched kiosk open in the same browser tab and Grafana instance. Product tiles labeled **Open product** open the product directly and close the learning panel while keeping saved guides and panel preferences. Browser Back returns to the kiosk after either launch.

While the kiosk is open, its launch parameters stay in the address bar, so you can share the URL or refresh to reopen the same catalog. Browser Back or Forward restores the kiosk from its URL. Selecting the exit button or pressing **Escape** removes the launch parameters, so refresh does not reopen it.

### Custom catalogs

Custom catalog selections must use HTTPS and come from Grafana’s guide CDN (`https://interactive-learning.grafana.net`), the current Grafana origin, or the origin of the configured default catalog. Endpoints must serve JSON directly without redirects, work without cookies or embedded credentials, and allow browser access through CORS when hosted on another origin.

A catalog can be a rules array or an object containing `rules` and an optional HTML `banner`. For example, this entry opens a bundled guide from Explore:

JSON [Copy code to clipboard] Copy

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Explore your metrics",
    "url": "bundled:prometheus-advanced-queries",
    "description": "Practice queries with your own metrics.",
    "type": "interactive",
    "page": "/explore"
  }
]
```

Set `interactiveLearning: false` on a rule to open a product directly. This requires a safe internal `page`; the guide `url` is retained but ignored. These rules show no guide completion progress and cannot be used by launch forms. Omit the field or set it to `true` to launch a guide. Deploy a Pathfinder version supporting this field before publishing the catalog: earlier strict catalog readers reject it.

The optional `page` for a guide must be a safe internal Grafana path. URL-launched kiosks ignore `targetUrl` destinations, keeping learners on the current instance. Guide URLs must be accepted content sources. Custom HTML banners are sanitized before display.

Without a custom catalog, the kiosk shows the bundled Grafana learning catalog. If a selected catalog fails, Pathfinder tries the configured default, then the generic online catalog, and finally a bundled fallback. Loading guide content can still require a network connection.

## Optional sandbox terminals and live sessions

These features depend on additional services and might not be available on your instance.

- **Sandbox terminals:** Require the separate Coda app plugin, configured and registered by an administrator. If available, **Enable Coda terminal** on the **Configuration** tab exposes sandbox steps. Grafana Cloud can also enable terminals remotely; in that case the setting is read-only. Sandbox availability and permitted roles depend on the Coda configuration.
- **Live sessions:** Allow a presenter to share guide actions with attendees. They are experimental and require a configured signalling service. The **Configuration** tab exposes the available settings when the feature is supported.

For changes affecting existing sandbox installations, refer to [Upgrade notes](../upgrade-notes/).
