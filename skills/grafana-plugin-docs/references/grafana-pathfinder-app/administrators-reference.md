# Administrators reference

This section covers the administrator features of the Interactive learning plugin. These features allow Grafana administrators to tailor the Interactive learning plugin to the needs of Grafana users.

## Accessing the configuration page

You can access the configuration page in two ways:

1. Click the settings gear icon in the top right corner of the expanded Interactive learning sidebar.
2. Navigate to **Administration** &gt; **Plugins and data** &gt; **Plugins**, search for “Interactive learning”.

## Configuration options

The plugin page contains several tabs that control different aspects of the Interactive learning plugin.

### Recommendations

The recommender service provides personalized documentation recommendations based on your current context in Grafana. When disabled, Interactive learning only displays bundled examples and static recommendations.

**To enable the recommender service:**

1. Review the data usage information to understand what data is collected and how it’s used.
2. Toggle **Enable context-aware recommendations** to enable the service.
3. Click **Save settings**.

When you enable the recommender service, Interactive learning sends contextual data to Grafana’s hosted recommendation service. The service uses this data to provide personalized documentation recommendations. For more information about data collection and privacy, refer to the [Terms and conditions](../terms-and-conditions/) page and the [Architecture](/docs/grafana/latest/pathfinder/architecture/) documentation.

> Note
>
> The recommender service is enabled by default for Grafana Cloud instances. For open source Grafana instances, administrators must enable it manually.

The recommender service URL is auto-selected based on the Grafana instance hostname (production, ops, or development). Most administrators do not need to change it.

### Custom guides (block editor)

Editors and admins can author custom interactive guides directly inside Grafana with the block editor and publish them to the docs panel for everyone on the instance. The block editor is available from the **Editor** tab in the docs panel — no dev mode is required. Permissions are enforced by Grafana role: only users with editor or admin role see the Editor tab and can publish guides.

For the end-user authoring workflow, refer to the [Block editor guide](../block-editor/).

### Auto-launch guide URL

You can configure a guide or documentation page to automatically open when users open the Interactive learning sidebar. This feature is useful for demo scenarios or onboarding new users.

**To configure auto-launch:**

1. Navigate to the **Plugin Configuration** section.
2. Enter the full URL of a learning path or documentation page in the **Auto-launch guide URL** field.
3. Click **Save configuration**.

Example URL:

- `https://grafana.com/tutorials/grafana-fundamentals/`

### Global link interception (Experimental)

Global link interception allows Interactive learning to intercept documentation links anywhere in Grafana and open them in the sidebar instead of a new tab.

> Warning
>
> This is an experimental feature and may not work with all documentation links.

**To enable global link interception:**

1. Navigate to the **Global Link Interception** section in the configuration page.
2. Toggle **Intercept documentation links globally** to enable the feature.
3. Click **Save configuration**.

When enabled, clicking documentation links anywhere in Grafana automatically opens the sidebar and displays the documentation inside. If the sidebar hasn’t fully loaded, links are queued and opened when ready.

**Keyboard modifiers:**

You can override link interception using keyboard modifiers:

- Hold **Ctrl** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd** (Mac) while clicking to open links in a new tab instead.
- Middle-click also opens links in a new tab.

### Open panel on launch

You can configure Interactive learning to automatically open when users first load Grafana.

> Warning
>
> This is an experimental feature.

**To enable auto-open:**

1. Navigate to the **Open Panel on Launch** section in the configuration page.
2. Toggle **Automatically open Interactive learning panel when Grafana loads** to enable the feature.
3. Click **Save configuration**.

The sidebar opens when Grafana loads for the first time in a browser session. It won’t reopen on subsequent page navigations within Grafana. The panel resets to auto-open behavior when you refresh the page or start a new browser session.

**Onboarding flow handling:** If a user first lands on the setup guide onboarding flow (`/a/grafana-setupguide-app/onboarding-flow`), the sidebar will wait and auto-open when they navigate away to normal Grafana pages. This ensures the onboarding experience isn’t interrupted while still providing the auto-open benefit.

**Multi-instance support:** If you have multiple Grafana instances (for example, multiple Cloud instances), each instance tracks its own auto-open state independently, so the sidebar will auto-open once per session on each instance.

### interactive guide features

interactive guides include auto-completion detection and timing parameters that control how guides behave.

#### Auto-completion detection (Experimental)

Auto-completion detection automatically marks guide steps as complete when users perform actions themselves without clicking **Do it** buttons.

> Warning
>
> This is an experimental feature.

**To enable auto-completion:**

1. Navigate to the **interactive guide Features** section in the configuration page.
2. Toggle **Enable automatic step completion** to enable the feature.
3. Click **Save configuration**.

When enabled, the system detects user actions and completes guide steps automatically for a more natural learning experience. Steps still verify requirements before completion.

When disabled, users must click **Do it** buttons to complete guide steps.

#### Advanced settings

You can fine-tune timing parameters for interactive guide behavior.

**Requirements check timeout:**

Maximum time to wait for requirement validation.

- Range: 1000-10000ms
- Default: 3000ms

**Guided step timeout:**

Maximum time to wait for users to complete guided steps.

- Range: 5000-120000ms (5s-2min)
- Default: 30000ms

To modify these settings:

1. Navigate to the **Advanced Settings** section under **interactive guide Features**.
2. Enter new values for the timeout fields.
3. Click **Save configuration** to apply changes, or click **Reset to defaults** to restore default values.

### Kiosk mode

Kiosk mode displays a full-screen catalog of interactive guides over Grafana, useful for in-booth and onboarding scenarios. When enabled, a kiosk button appears in the sidebar header and the catalog opens over the rest of the UI.

**To enable kiosk mode:**

1. Navigate to the **Interactive Features** tab on the plugin configuration page.
2. Toggle **Enable kiosk mode** (`enableKioskMode`).
3. Click **Save configuration**.

You can configure a custom CDN URL for the kiosk rules JSON and supply an HTML banner block at the top of the overlay (sanitized via DOMPurify before render). When opened from the sidebar, each catalog tile opens its target guide in a new tab via the `?doc=` deep link.

#### Open a kiosk from a link

Add `pathfinderKiosk=1` to a Grafana URL to open the default kiosk, even when **Enable kiosk mode** is off. Pathfinder must still be available on the instance. This does not change saved settings or enable the sidebar kiosk button.

To select a different catalog, also supply `kioskRulesUrl` with the URL-encoded address of its JSON file:

text [Copy code to clipboard] Copy

```text
https://your-stack.grafana.net/?pathfinderKiosk=1
https://your-stack.grafana.net/?pathfinderKiosk=1&kioskRulesUrl=https%3A%2F%2Finteractive-learning.grafana.net%2Fmy-kiosk.json
```

Replace the example JSON address with your published catalog. The rules URL alone does not open kiosk mode. Use `&` to append these parameters when the Grafana URL already contains a query string.

Custom selections must use HTTPS and come from `https://interactive-learning.grafana.net`, the current Grafana origin, or the origin of the configured default kiosk URL. Same-origin HTTP is allowed on localhost for development. Catalog endpoints must serve JSON directly without redirects, permit browser access through CORS when cross-origin, and work without cookies or embedded credentials.

If the selection is missing or cannot load, Pathfinder uses the configured default kiosk. If no default is configured, it shows the bundled catalog immediately without fetching a catalog. If a configured default fails, it loads the [generic learning kiosk](https://interactive-learning.grafana.net/guides/kiosk/default/rules.json). If that catalog also fails, it uses a bundled copy of the generic catalog. The collection covers core concepts, sample-data visualizations and transformations, and playlists on the current instance, plus Grafana Cloud guides for IRM and Frontend Observability. Cards describe any permissions or data source prerequisites; no guide requires Grafana Play or a customer-specific instance. The bundled catalog still needs a network connection to load guide content. Catalogs can use the existing rules array or an object containing `rules` and an optional `banner`. Guide URLs must pass Pathfinder’s content URL validation; target Grafana instances must use HTTPS (or same-origin localhost HTTP).

URL-launched kiosks open guides in the **same browser tab and Grafana instance**, ignoring presentation-only `targetUrl` values. To choose the starting page, add an optional `page` path to a catalog entry:

JSON [Copy code to clipboard] Copy

```json
{
  "title": "Explore your metrics",
  "url": "bundled:prometheus-advanced-queries",
  "description": "Practice queries with your own metrics.",
  "type": "interactive",
  "page": "/explore"
}
```

`page` must be a safe internal Grafana path. Query parameters and fragments are preserved in the same-tab destination. If omitted, the guide’s known starting page is used when available; otherwise, the user stays on the current page. Selecting a guide exits the kiosk and opens the guide sidebar. Sidebar-launched presentation kiosks retain their new-tab behavior and `targetUrl` support.

The **Exit kiosk** button stays visible while scrolling and returns users to the page underneath. **Escape** also exits. Kiosk colors follow the active light or dark Grafana theme. Catalogs without a banner (including empty or whitespace-only banners) display a branded **Grafana learning** banner. Custom HTML banners retain their author-supplied styling.

Refreshing while the kiosk is open reopens the selected catalog. Closing removes only the kiosk launch parameters. Opening from the sidebar uses the configured default again. Document and controller links take precedence when combined with kiosk parameters. Grafana’s own `kiosk` parameter remains independent.

### Coda sandbox terminal

When enabled, Coda gives a guide direct access to a 30-minute sandbox VM through a terminal panel inside the docs panel. This is useful for guides that walk through Linux configuration, Alloy scenarios, or sample-app setup.

The terminal requires the separate **Coda app plugin** (`grafana-coda-app`) to be installed, enabled, and registered with a Coda enrollment key. Registration happens on that plugin’s own configuration page, not this one. Once it is registered, toggle **Enable Coda terminal** in Interactive learning’s settings to expose the terminal block types in the block editor and the terminal panel in the docs panel.

While the Coda app plugin is missing or unregistered, Interactive learning hides the terminal panel and the terminal block types, and the configuration page reports which step is outstanding. See the [Coda terminal integration](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-pathfinder-app/blob/main/docs/developer/CODA.md) developer reference for details.

On Grafana Cloud, Grafana Labs can also turn the terminal on remotely for a stack. When that happens, the **Enable Coda terminal** toggle shows as on and is not editable, labelled as feature-flag driven; your own saved setting is left untouched, so the terminal goes away again when the flag is turned off.

### Live sessions (experimental)

Live sessions enable a presenter to broadcast their **Show me** and **Do it** actions to attendees over a peer-to-peer WebRTC connection. This is gated behind a plugin setting and requires a PeerJS signalling server. See the [Live sessions developer reference](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-pathfinder-app/blob/main/docs/developer/LIVE_SESSIONS.md) for setup, scaling considerations, and known limitations.

### Dev mode

Dev mode is a per-user developer feature that exposes the DOM Selector Debug Panel and similar diagnostic tools.

> Warning
>
> Dev mode disables several security protections and should only be enabled in isolated development environments. Never enable dev mode in production or when viewing untrusted content.

Dev mode is only visible when you access the configuration page with `?dev=true` in the URL or when it’s already enabled for your user.

**Security protections disabled in dev mode:**

- Bypasses branch validation for GitHub repositories.
- Allows loading content from any localhost URL.
- Exposes debug tools that can manipulate the Grafana DOM.
- Bypasses source validation for interactive content.

**To enable dev mode:**

1. Navigate to the configuration page with `?dev=true` in the URL.
2. Review the security warnings.
3. Toggle **Dev Mode** to enable the feature.

The page reloads automatically to apply changes. Dev mode is stored per-user and requires admin permissions to change.

When dev mode is enabled, you can also configure the **Recommender service URL** to point to a local development instance.

> Note
>
> The block editor and kiosk mode used to require dev mode in earlier versions. Both are now available without dev mode — the block editor through the **Editor** tab, kiosk mode through the `enableKioskMode` plugin setting.
