# Prometheus Alerting

Prometheus Alerting is a Grafana app plugin for managing alert rules and Alertmanager configuration across Prometheus, Mimir, Cortex, and Loki data sources, all from within Grafana.

It brings the native Prometheus and Alertmanager alerting experience into Grafana, so you can manage external alerting stacks without leaving the Grafana UI.

> Note
>
> This plugin works with data source-managed alert rules and Alertmanager resources only. It doesn’t manage Grafana-managed alert rules or the built-in Grafana Alertmanager. For those, refer to [Grafana Alerting](/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/).

## Requirements

To use the Prometheus Alerting plugin, you need:

- Grafana 13.1.0 or later (OSS, Enterprise, or Cloud).
- A Prometheus, Mimir, Cortex, or Loki data source, to manage alert rules.
- An Alertmanager data source, to manage routing, receivers, silences, and the rest of the Alertmanager configuration.

You don’t need both. Rule management works without an Alertmanager, and the Alertmanager pages work without a rules source.
