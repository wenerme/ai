# Troubleshoot Google BigQuery data source issues

This document provides solutions to common issues you may encounter when configuring or using the Google BigQuery data source. For configuration instructions, refer to [Configure the BigQuery data source](/docs/plugins/grafana-bigquery-datasource/latest/configure/).

## Plugin version errors

These errors are the most common cause of issues with the BigQuery data source. Most generic error messages on **Save &amp; test** are caused by running an outdated plugin version.

### “An error occurred within the plugin” or generic plugin errors

**Symptoms:**

- **Save &amp; test** fails with “An error occurred within the plugin”
- Generic “plugin error” messages without specific details
- Features that previously worked stop functioning after a Grafana upgrade

**Solutions:**

1. Update the BigQuery plugin to the latest version. In Grafana, go to **Administration** &gt; **Plugins and data** &gt; **Plugins**, search for BigQuery, and check for updates.
2. Restart your Grafana instance after updating. Plugin updates may not take effect until the instance is restarted.
3. Verify the plugin version is compatible with your Grafana version. Plugin version 3.x requires Grafana 11.6.0 or later. For older Grafana versions, use plugin version 2.x (requires Grafana 10.4.8+) or 1.x.

### “Plugin not registered”

**Symptoms:**

- Error message indicates the plugin is not registered
- Occurs after pod restarts in Grafana Cloud
- Data source was previously working but becomes unavailable

**Solutions:**

1. Reinstall the plugin. In Grafana Cloud, go to **Administration** &gt; **Plugins and data** &gt; **Plugins**, find the BigQuery plugin, uninstall it, and install it again.
2. If the issue persists after reinstalling, contact [Grafana Support](/support/).

## Authentication errors

These errors occur when credentials are invalid, missing, or don’t have the required permissions.

### “Access denied” or “Permission denied”

**Symptoms:**

- Save &amp; test fails with access denied errors
- Queries return permission denied messages
- Projects, datasets, or tables don’t load in drop-downs

**Possible causes and solutions:**

| Cause                                  | Solution                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing BigQuery roles                 | Assign the **BigQuery Data Viewer** and **BigQuery Job User** roles to the service account.                       |
| Service account key expired or revoked | Create a new key in the Google Cloud Console and update the data source configuration.                            |
| Wrong project selected                 | Verify the default project matches where your data is located.                                                    |
| API not enabled                        | Enable the [BigQuery API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/bigquery.googleapis.com) in your project. |
| Dataset or table-level restrictions    | Grant the service account access to the specific datasets or tables, not just the project.                        |

### 403 errors on queries when Save &amp; test passes

**Symptoms:**

- **Save &amp; test** succeeds but queries return 403 permission denied errors
- Only some queries fail while others work

**Solutions:**

1. The service account has project-level access but is missing dataset or table-level permissions. In the BigQuery Console, verify the service account has read access to the specific datasets being queried.
2. If querying across multiple projects, ensure the service account has the **BigQuery Data Viewer** and **BigQuery Job User** roles in each target project.
3. Ensure the [BigQuery API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/bigquery.googleapis.com) is enabled in each target project, not just the default project.

### Project dropdown not populating

**Symptoms:**

- The GCP project dropdown in the query editor is empty
- No projects are listed when configuring the data source
- Other query features work correctly

**Solutions:**

1. Grant the service account the `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission. This permission is included in the **Browser** role (`roles/browser`) or can be assigned through a custom role.
2. Ensure the [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com) is enabled in the project.
3. Verify the service account has access to the projects you expect to see listed. The dropdown only shows projects where the service account has at least one role.

### “Invalid JWT signature” or “Invalid token”

**Symptoms:**

- Data source test fails immediately
- Error mentions JWT or token validation

**Solutions:**

1. Verify the service account key file is valid JSON.
2. Check that the private key in the configuration matches the key file.
3. Ensure the `tokenUri` is set to `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`.
4. Create a new service account key if the current one is corrupted.

### “Service account impersonation failed”

**Symptoms:**

- Queries fail when using service account impersonation
- Error mentions impersonation or token creation
- Only a “Service account email to impersonate” field is visible and it’s unclear how to proceed

**Solutions:**

1. Verify you have configured authentication *before* enabling impersonation. Service account impersonation requires an underlying authentication method (either Google JWT File or GCE Default Service Account). Upload your authenticating service account’s JSON key first, then enable the impersonation checkbox.
2. Verify the authenticating service account has the **Service Account Token Creator** role (`roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`) on the impersonated service account.
3. Ensure the impersonated service account has the required BigQuery roles (**BigQuery Data Viewer** and **BigQuery Job User**).
4. Check that the impersonated service account email is the full email address (for example, `my-sa@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`).

For detailed setup instructions including `gcloud` commands, refer to [Service account impersonation](/docs/plugins/grafana-bigquery-datasource/latest/configure/#service-account-impersonation).

### Workload Identity Federation authentication failing

**Symptoms:**

- Queries fail when using Workload Identity Federation (WIF)
- Errors mention token exchange, invalid audience, or the workload identity pool provider
- The project, dataset, or table selectors in the query editor show load errors because the default project can’t be resolved
- Authentication works on interactive dashboards but fails for alerts, scheduled reports, or public dashboards

**Solutions:**

1. Confirm you’re on Grafana Cloud. Workload Identity Federation is available on Grafana Cloud only, because Grafana Cloud exchanges the signed-in user’s external OIDC token for a short-lived Google Cloud access token before the request reaches the plugin.
2. Verify the **Workload Identity Pool Provider** resource path is correct and uses the format `projects/<project-number>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/<pool-id>/providers/<provider-id>`. Use the project **number** (a numeric ID such as `123456789`), not the project ID (such as `my-project`).
3. Check the provider’s attribute mappings in Google Cloud. The `google.subject` attribute must map to the correct claim from your identity provider (for example, `assertion.sub` — the exact mapping depends on your provider’s claim format).
4. Verify the BigQuery permissions are granted to the correct principal:

   - **Without impersonation** — the WIF pool principal needs the **BigQuery Data Viewer** and **BigQuery Job User** roles, and the **Service account email** field must be left blank.
   - **With impersonation** — the impersonated service account needs the **BigQuery Data Viewer** and **BigQuery Job User** roles, the WIF pool principal needs the **Service Account Token Creator** role on that service account, and the impersonated service account’s full email must be entered in the **Service account email** field.
5. Ensure your Grafana Cloud stack’s SSO integration is configured against the same OIDC provider that the workload identity pool trusts. If the signed-in user’s identity isn’t available, Grafana Cloud can’t exchange it for a Google Cloud access token.

> Note
>
> Credentials from Workload Identity Federation are tied to the signed-in user’s active session — there is no long-lived credential available to the Grafana backend. This means any feature that runs without a user present will not work, including alerting, scheduled reports, and public dashboards. If you rely on these features, use a service account key (JWT) instead.

For detailed setup instructions, refer to [Workload Identity Federation](/docs/plugins/grafana-bigquery-datasource/latest/configure/#workload-identity-federation).

### Forward OAuth Identity not working

**Symptoms:**

- Queries fail when using Forward OAuth Identity
- User sees authentication errors after logging in
- OAuth scopes appear correct in configuration files but authentication still fails

**Solutions:**

1. Verify the OAuth scopes are configured in Grafana’s OAuth settings: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery` and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` (if querying data linked to Google Drive).
2. Ensure users have authenticated with Google OAuth before accessing BigQuery dashboards.
3. Check that the **Default project** is configured in the data source settings.
4. If you updated OAuth scopes in a configuration file but the data source still fails, the Grafana database may be storing stale settings that override the file-based configuration. To fix this, open the data source settings in the Grafana UI, re-enter the correct scopes, and click **Save &amp; test**.

> Note
>
> Forward OAuth Identity doesn’t support alerting or other background features that require credentials when users aren’t logged in.

## Connection errors

These errors occur when Grafana cannot reach Google BigQuery endpoints.

### “Connection refused” or timeout errors

**Symptoms:**

- Data source test times out
- Queries fail with network errors
- Intermittent connection failures

**Solutions:**

1. Verify network connectivity from the Grafana server to Google Cloud endpoints.
2. Check firewall rules allow outbound HTTPS (port 443) to `*.googleapis.com`.
3. If using a proxy, ensure it’s configured correctly in Grafana’s settings.
4. For Grafana Cloud accessing private resources, configure [Private data source connect](/docs/grafana-cloud/connect-externally-hosted/private-data-source-connect/).

### “Could not resolve host”

**Symptoms:**

- DNS resolution errors in logs
- Unable to reach Google API endpoints

**Solutions:**

1. Verify DNS settings on the Grafana server.
2. Test DNS resolution: `nslookup bigquery.googleapis.com`.
3. Check for network policy restrictions blocking external DNS.

### Private data source connect (PDC) errors

**Symptoms:**

- “socks connect tcp … network unreachable” error messages
- SSH tunnel opens but closes immediately
- Intermittent connection failures when using PDC
- Data source works locally but fails in Grafana Cloud with PDC

**Solutions:**

1. Verify the PDC agent is running and connected. Check the agent logs and the PDC status in your Grafana Cloud instance under **Administration** &gt; **Private data source connect**.
2. Restart the PDC agent if you see “socks connect tcp … network unreachable” errors. This error typically indicates the agent has lost its connection and needs to be restarted.
3. Run multiple PDC agents for high availability. A single agent creates a single point of failure — if it goes down, all data sources using PDC become unavailable.
4. If the SSH tunnel opens but immediately closes, this can indicate a plugin installation error rather than a network problem. Verify the BigQuery plugin is correctly installed and not in an error state (refer to [Plugin version errors](#plugin-version-errors)).
5. Ensure the PDC agent’s network allows outbound HTTPS (port 443) to `*.googleapis.com`.

For general PDC setup and configuration, refer to [Private data source connect](/docs/grafana-cloud/connect-externally-hosted/private-data-source-connect/).

## Configuration errors

These errors occur during data source setup or provisioning.

### “Failed to save datasource”

**Symptoms:**

- Unable to save data source configuration
- Error when clicking **Save &amp; test**

**Solutions:**

1. Verify all required fields are filled in.
2. Check that the JSON key file is valid and complete.
3. Ensure Grafana has write permissions to its data directory.

### Provisioning errors

**Symptoms:**

- Provisioned data source doesn’t appear
- Errors in Grafana logs about provisioning

**Solutions:**

1. Verify YAML syntax is correct (use a YAML validator).
2. Check that `type` is set to `grafana-bigquery-datasource`.
3. Ensure `authenticationType` matches the credentials provided.
4. For `privateKey` in `secureJsonData`, ensure newlines are preserved (use `|` for multiline strings in YAML).

**Example with multiline private key:**

YAML [Copy code to clipboard] Copy

```yaml
apiVersion: 1
datasources:
  - name: BigQuery
    type: grafana-bigquery-datasource
    jsonData:
      authenticationType: jwt
      clientEmail: <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
      defaultProject: <PROJECT_ID>
      tokenUri: https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
    secureJsonData:
      privateKey: |
        -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
        <KEY_CONTENT>
        -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

## Query errors

These errors occur when executing queries against BigQuery.

### “No data” or empty results

**Symptoms:**

- Query executes without error but returns no data
- Charts show “No data” message
- Tables are empty

**Possible causes and solutions:**

Expand table

| Cause                             | Solution                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Time range doesn’t contain data   | Expand the dashboard time range or verify data exists in BigQuery for the selected period. |
| Wrong project, dataset, or table  | Verify you’ve selected the correct resources in the query.                                 |
| Filter conditions too restrictive | Review `WHERE` clauses and ensure they match existing data.                                |
| Macro not expanding correctly     | Check the generated SQL in Query Inspector to verify macro expansion.                      |

### “Syntax error” or “Query parse error”

**Symptoms:**

- Query fails with syntax error
- Error points to a specific position in the query

**Solutions:**

1. Use the query validator in the SQL editor to identify syntax issues.
2. Verify table and column names are correctly quoted with backticks.
3. Check that macros are used correctly (for example, `$__timeFilter(column)` not `$__timeFilter`).
4. Ensure BigQuery Standard SQL syntax is used, not Legacy SQL.

### Query timeout

**Symptoms:**

- Query runs for a long time then fails
- Error mentions timeout or exceeded limits
- “context deadline exceeded” error

**Solutions:**

1. Reduce the amount of data your query scans. There is no configurable query timeout in the BigQuery data source settings — the timeout is determined by BigQuery’s server-side limits and the Grafana instance’s global query timeout.
2. Narrow the time range to reduce data volume.
3. Add partition filters. BigQuery partitioned tables perform significantly better when you filter on the partition column using `$__timeFilter`.
4. Avoid `SELECT *` — select only the columns you need.
5. Add a `LIMIT` clause during development and exploration.
6. Consider pre-aggregating data for frequently-used queries.

> Note
>
> Queries that process terabytes of data will likely exceed any reasonable timeout setting. In these cases, refactor the query to reduce the data scanned rather than increasing the timeout. Use partition filters, narrow the time range, or pre-aggregate data in BigQuery before querying from Grafana.

### “Query exceeded resource limits”

**Symptoms:**

- Error mentions resource limits or quota exceeded
- Query fails after processing some data

**Solutions:**

1. Simplify the query by reducing JOINs or subqueries.
2. Break complex queries into smaller parts.
3. Use approximate aggregation functions where precision isn’t critical.
4. Request a quota increase in Google Cloud Console if needed.

### Incorrect data types

**Symptoms:**

- Numbers appear as strings
- Timestamps aren’t recognized
- Visualization doesn’t work as expected

**Solutions:**

1. Use explicit type casting in your query: `CAST(column AS INT64)`.
2. Alias timestamp columns as `time`: `SELECT timestamp_col AS time`.
3. Verify the column types in BigQuery match what Grafana expects.

## Template variable errors

These errors occur when using template variables with the data source.

### Variables return no values

**Symptoms:**

- Variable drop-down is empty
- “No options found” message appears

**Solutions:**

1. Test the data source connection using **Save &amp; test**.
2. Run the variable query manually in the query editor to verify it returns results.
3. Check that the service account has permission to query the tables referenced in the variable query.
4. For chained variables, ensure parent variables have valid selections.

### Variables are slow to load

**Symptoms:**

- Dashboard takes a long time to load
- Variable drop-downs are unresponsive

**Solutions:**

1. Set variable refresh to **On dashboard load** instead of **On time range change**.
2. Add `LIMIT` to variable queries to reduce result count.
3. Simplify variable queries to scan less data.
4. Use caching if available in your Grafana edition.

### Variable value not interpolated

**Symptoms:**

- Query shows `$variable` literally instead of the value
- Error about unknown identifier

**Solutions:**

1. Verify the variable name matches exactly (case-sensitive).
2. Use `${variable}` syntax when the variable is adjacent to other text.
3. Check the Query Inspector to see how variables are interpolated.

### Stale variables in scheduled reports

**Symptoms:**

- Scheduled reports (Grafana Reporting) use outdated variable values
- Reports always render with the same variable selection instead of refreshing dynamically
- Variable values in the report don’t match what’s currently in BigQuery

**Solutions:**

1. Scheduled reports can cache variable values at the time the report is created. If the underlying BigQuery data changes, the report continues using the original values.
2. To force a dynamic refresh at runtime, use the [Grafana Reporting API](/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http_api/reporting/) to clear the report’s saved variable configuration. Remove the `templateVars` field from the report definition so variables are evaluated fresh at each scheduled run.
3. Alternatively, recreate the report after updating variable queries to pick up the latest values.

## Performance issues

These issues relate to slow queries or high costs.

### Queries are slow

**Symptoms:**

- Dashboards take a long time to load
- Queries timeout frequently
- High bytes billed per query

**Solutions:**

1. **Use partition filters.** Always filter on the partition column using `$__timeFilter(partition_column)`. Without a partition filter, BigQuery scans the entire table regardless of the dashboard time range.
2. **Narrow the time range.** Shorter time ranges scan less data. Use the dashboard time picker to limit the window.
3. **Avoid `SELECT *`.** Select only the columns your visualization needs. BigQuery is columnar, so fewer columns means less data scanned.
4. **Add `LIMIT` during development.** Use `LIMIT` when building and testing queries to reduce scan costs.
5. **Use appropriate aggregation intervals.** Aggregate data to match the visualization granularity — there’s no benefit in returning per-second data for a chart showing daily trends.
6. **Set `Max bytes billed`.** Configure this in **Additional Settings** to prevent unexpectedly expensive queries from running.
7. **Enable `Restrict to accessible datasets`.** Configure this in **Additional Settings** to reject queries that reference tables outside the projects the data source has access to. This blocks queries against public datasets such as `bigquery-public-data`, which IAM cannot restrict.
8. Consider using BigQuery BI Engine for frequently accessed data.

### High query costs

**Symptoms:**

- Unexpected BigQuery charges
- Quota warnings from Google Cloud

**Solutions:**

1. Review query costs in BigQuery Console under **Query history**.
2. Use `$__timeFilter` to limit data scanned to the dashboard time range.
3. Avoid `SELECT *` and select only required columns.
4. Set appropriate dashboard refresh intervals (don’t refresh more often than needed).
5. Consider enabling query caching in Grafana Enterprise or Grafana Cloud.

### Storage API errors

**Symptoms:**

- Errors when using the Storage API option
- “Storage API not enabled” message

**Solutions:**

1. Enable the [BigQuery Storage API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/bigquerystorage.googleapis.com) in your project.
2. Ensure the service account has the **BigQuery Read Session User** role.
3. Disable Storage API if not needed for your use case.

> Note
>
> The Storage API doesn’t work with Forward OAuth Identity authentication.

## Grafana Cloud vs. self-hosted differences

If you are migrating from self-hosted Grafana to Grafana Cloud, be aware of the following behavioral differences with the BigQuery plugin.

### Dataset and table browsing

On self-hosted Grafana, the BigQuery plugin connects directly to Google Cloud APIs. On Grafana Cloud, the connection may route through [Private data source connect (PDC)](/docs/grafana-cloud/connect-externally-hosted/private-data-source-connect/) if your BigQuery resources are not publicly accessible. This routing can affect the speed at which datasets and tables load in the query editor dropdowns.

Whether all projects are visible in the project selector depends on service account permissions rather than PDC. Ensure the service account has `resourcemanager.projects.get` on each project you expect to see listed.

If dataset browsing works on self-hosted but not on Grafana Cloud, verify your PDC agent is running and that the service account permissions are identical between environments.

### Query variable substitution

Template variable substitution behavior is consistent between self-hosted and Grafana Cloud. If you observe differences after migration, check:

1. The plugin version matches between environments. Older plugin versions may handle multi-value variables differently.
2. The data source configuration is identical — particularly the **Default project** and **Processing location** settings.
3. Variable queries that rely on `$__interval` or time-range macros may produce different results if the default dashboard time range differs between environments.

## Auditing and usage tracking

To track which Grafana users are running BigQuery queries:

- **Grafana audit logging** (available in Grafana Enterprise and Grafana Cloud) can identify the user and data source associated with a query request, but does not log the specific SQL query text or which BigQuery tables were accessed. For details, refer to [Auditing](/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/audit-grafana/).
- **BigQuery audit logs** in GCP provide full query-level detail, including the SQL text, tables accessed, bytes scanned, and job metadata. Enable [Cloud Audit Logs for BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/auditlogs) to capture this information.

For complete query-level auditing, use BigQuery’s audit logs. You can correlate them with Grafana audit logs by matching timestamps and the service account identity.

## BigQuery metrics in Google Cloud Monitoring

If you use Google Cloud Monitoring to track BigQuery usage metrics (such as `bigquery.googleapis.com/query/count` or `bigquery.googleapis.com/query/execution_times`), be aware that GCP attributes these metrics to the project that *runs* the query job, not the project that *hosts* the data. This means:

- If your Grafana service account runs jobs in Project A but queries data in Project B, the metrics appear under Project A.
- This is standard [GCP metric attribution behavior](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/monitoring), not something controlled by the Grafana plugin.

When building Cloud Monitoring dashboards for BigQuery usage, filter by the project configured as the **Default project** in the BigQuery data source settings (or the project specified in the `$__timeFilter` query), as that is where job metrics are attributed.

## Enable debug logging

To capture detailed error information for troubleshooting:

1. Set the Grafana log level to `debug` in the configuration file:

   ini [Copy code to clipboard] Copy

   ```ini
   [log]
   level = debug
   ```
2. Restart Grafana.
3. Review logs in `/var/log/grafana/grafana.log` (or your configured log location).
4. Look for `bigquery` or `grafana-bigquery-datasource` entries.
5. Reset the log level to `info` after troubleshooting to avoid excessive log volume.

## Use Query Inspector

The Query Inspector helps debug query issues:

1. Open a panel in edit mode.
2. Click the **Query Inspector** button.
3. Review the **Query** tab to see the exact SQL sent to BigQuery.
4. Check the **Stats** tab for query timing information.
5. Look at the **JSON** tab for the raw response data.

## Get additional help
