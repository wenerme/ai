# Testing and Mocking

Testing and mocking are essential for building reliable applications. In this section, we'll explore how to test your procedures and routers effectively, as well as how to create mock implementations for testing purposes.

## Testing

For fast, focused tests, use [Server-Side Clients](/docs/client/server-side) or call your procedures directly with `call`. This lets you verify validation, middleware, and handler logic without going through HTTP.

```ts
import { call } from '@orpc/server'

it('lists planets', async () => {
  await expect(
    call(router.planet.list, { page: 1, size: 10 })
  ).resolves.toEqual([
    { id: '1', name: 'Earth' },
    { id: '2', name: 'Mars' },
  ])
})
```

> **info**: For a production-like test setup, create [fetch-based internal clients](/docs/best-practices/optimizing-ssr#implementation).

## Mocking

Use the [Implementer](/docs/contract/implementation) to create test-specific versions of a [procedure](/docs/procedure) or [router](/docs/router). This is useful when one part of your system depends on another procedure, but your test should not execute the real implementation.

```ts twoslash
import { router } from './shared/planet'
// ---cut---
import { implement } from '@orpc/server'

const fakeListPlanet = implement(router.planet.list).handler(() => [])
```

Use `fakeListPlanet` anywhere your test would normally use the real `listPlanet` procedure.

> **info**: `implement` is also useful for building mock servers in frontend tests.

> **warning**: `implement` does not support [lazy routers](/docs/router#lazy-router) directly. If you need to mock one, first [unlazy the router](/docs/contract/router#router-to-contract).
